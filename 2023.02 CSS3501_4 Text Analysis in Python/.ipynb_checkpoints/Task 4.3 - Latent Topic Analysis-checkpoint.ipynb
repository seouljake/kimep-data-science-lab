According to her, the sanctions are specifically designed to minimize negative impacts on allies and partners, including Kazakhstan.“The United States government has also taken many steps such as issuing licenses to help minimize the impact of these sanctions on the U.S. and partner economies,” she added.Regarding the Kazakh government’s response to the January unrest and allegations of excessive use of force by the authorities, Zeya said that, “We are encouraging a transparent response on the part of the government and one that results in full accountability,” adding that the U.S. is ready to partner with Kazakhstan in supporting the advancements of human rights.Zeya added that the United States also looks forward to working with Kazakhstan during its second term on the UN Human Rights Council. “It’s more important than ever that the council fulfills its mandate to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and that it is willing to shine a spotlight on countries and issues of concern,” she said.'"
