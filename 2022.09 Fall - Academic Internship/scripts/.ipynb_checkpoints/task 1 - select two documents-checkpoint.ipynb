       "\"[ The Tragedie of Hamlet by William Shakespeare 1599 ] Actus Primus . Scoena Prima . Enter Barnardo and Francisco two Centinels . Barnardo . Who ' s there ? Fran . Nay answer me : Stand & vnfold your selfe Bar . Long liue the King Fran . Barnardo ? Bar . He Fran . You come most carefully vpon your houre Bar . ' Tis now strook twelue , get thee to bed Francisco Fran . For this releefe much thankes : ' Tis bitter cold , And I am sicke at heart Barn . Haue you had quiet Guard ? Fran . Not a Mouse stirring Barn . Well , goodnight . If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus , the Riuals of my Watch , bid them make hast . Enter Horatio and Marcellus . Fran . I thinke I heare them . Stand : who ' s there ? Hor . Friends to this ground Mar . And Leige - men to the Dane Fran . Giue you good night Mar . O farwel honest Soldier , who hath relieu ' d you ? Fra . Barnardo ha ' s my place : giue you goodnight . Exit Fran . Mar . Holla Barnardo Bar . Say , what is Horatio there ? Hor . A peece of him Bar . Welcome Horatio , welcome good Marcellus Mar . What , ha ' s this thing appear ' d againe to night Bar . I haue seene nothing Mar . Horatio saies , ' tis but our Fantasie , And will not let beleefe take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight , twice seene of vs , Therefore I haue intreated him along With vs , to watch the minutes of this Night , That if againe this Apparition come , He may approue our eyes , and speake to it Hor . Tush , tush , ' twill not appeare Bar . Sit downe a - while , And let vs once againe assaile your eares , That are so fortified against our Story , What we two Nights haue seene Hor . Well , sit we downe , And let vs heare Barnardo speake of this Barn . Last night of all , When yond same Starre that ' s Westward from the Pole Had made his course t ' illume that part of Heauen Where now it burnes , Marcellus and my selfe , The Bell then beating one Mar . Peace , breake thee of : Enter the Ghost . Looke where it comes againe Barn . In the same figure , like the King that ' s dead Mar . Thou art a Scholler ; speake to it Horatio Barn . Lookes it not like the King ? Marke it Horatio Hora . Most like : It harrowes me with fear & wonder Barn . It would be spoke too Mar . Question it Horatio Hor . What art thou that vsurp ' st this time of night , Together with that Faire and Warlike forme In which the Maiesty of buried Denmarke Did sometimes march : By Heauen I charge thee speake Mar . It is offended Barn . See , it stalkes away Hor . Stay : speake ; speake : I Charge thee , speake . Exit the Ghost . Mar . ' Tis gone , and will not answer Barn . How now Horatio ? You tremble & look pale : Is not this something more then Fantasie ? What thinke you on ' t ? Hor . Before my God , I might not this beleeue Without the sensible and true auouch Of mine owne eyes Mar . Is it not like the King ? Hor . As thou art to thy selfe , Such was the very Armour he had on , When th ' Ambitious Norwey combatted : So frown ' d he once , when in an angry parle He smot the sledded Pollax on the Ice . ' Tis strange Mar . Thus twice before , and iust at this dead houre , With Martiall stalke , hath he gone by our Watch Hor . In what particular thought to work , I know not : But in the grosse and scope of my Opinion , This boades some strange erruption to our State Mar . Good now sit downe , & tell me he that knowes Why this same strict and most obseruant Watch , So nightly toyles the subiect of the Land , And why such dayly Cast of Brazon Cannon And Forraigne Mart for Implements of warre : Why such impresse of Ship - wrights , whose sore Taske Do ' s not diuide the Sunday from the weeke , What might be toward , that this sweaty hast Doth make the Night ioynt - Labourer with the day : Who is ' t that can informe me ? Hor . That can I , At least the whisper goes so : Our last King , Whose Image euen but now appear ' d to vs , Was ( as you know ) by Fortinbras of Norway , ( Thereto prick ' d on by a most emulate Pride ) Dar ' d to the Combate . In which , our Valiant Hamlet , ( For so this side of our knowne world esteem ' d him ) Did slay this Fortinbras : who by a Seal ' d Compact , Well ratified by Law , and Heraldrie , Did forfeite ( with his life ) all those his Lands Which he stood seiz ' d on , to the Conqueror : Against the which , a Moity competent Was gaged by our King : which had return ' d To the Inheritance of Fortinbras , Had he bin Vanquisher , as by the same Cou ' nant And carriage of the Article designe , His fell to Hamlet . Now sir , young Fortinbras , Of vnimproued Mettle , hot and full , Hath in the skirts of Norway , heere and there , Shark ' d vp a List of Landlesse Resolutes , For Foode and Diet , to some Enterprize That hath a stomacke in ' t : which is no other ( And it doth well appeare vnto our State ) But to recouer of vs by strong hand And termes Compulsatiue , those foresaid Lands So by his Father lost : and this ( I take it ) Is the maine Motiue of our Preparations , The Sourse of this our Watch , and the cheefe head Of this post - hast , and Romage in the Land . Enter Ghost againe . But soft , behold : Loe , where it comes againe : Ile crosse it , though it blast me . Stay Illusion : If thou hast any sound , or vse of Voyce , Speake to me . If there be any good thing to be done , That may to thee do ease , and grace to me ; speak to me . If thou art priuy to thy Countries Fate ( Which happily foreknowing may auoyd ) Oh speake . Or , if thou hast vp - hoorded in thy life Extorted Treasure in the wombe of Earth , ( For which , they say , you Spirits oft walke in death ) Speake of it . Stay , and speake . Stop it Marcellus Mar . Shall I strike at it with my Partizan ? Hor . Do , if it will not stand Barn . ' Tis heere Hor . ' Tis heere Mar . ' Tis gone . Exit Ghost . We do it wrong , being so Maiesticall To offer it the shew of Violence , For it is as the Ayre , invulnerable , And our vaine blowes , malicious Mockery Barn . It was about to speake , when the Cocke crew Hor . And then it started , like a guilty thing Vpon a fearfull Summons . I haue heard , The Cocke that is the Trumpet to the day , Doth with his lofty and shrill - sounding Throate Awake the God of Day : and at his warning , Whether in Sea , or Fire , in Earth , or Ayre , Th ' extrauagant , and erring Spirit , hyes To his Confine . And of the truth heerein , This present Obiect made probation Mar . It faded on the crowing of the Cocke . Some sayes , that euer ' gainst that Season comes Wherein our Sauiours Birch is celebrated , The Bird of Dawning singeth all night long : And then ( they say ) no Spirit can walke abroad , The nights are wholsome , then no Planets strike , No Faiery talkes , nor Witch hath power to Charme : So hallow ' d , and so gracious is the time Hor . So haue I heard , and do in part beleeue it . But looke , the Morne in Russet mantle clad , Walkes o ' re the dew of yon high Easterne Hill , Breake we our Watch vp , and by my aduice Let vs impart what we haue seene to night Vnto yong Hamlet . For vpon my life , This Spirit dumbe to vs , will speake to him : Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it , As needfull in our Loues , fitting our Duty ? Mar . Let do ' t I pray , and I this morning know Where we shall finde him most conueniently . Exeunt . Scena Secunda . Enter Claudius King of Denmarke , Gertrude the Queene , Hamlet , Polonius , Laertes , and his Sister Ophelia , Lords Attendant . King . Though yet of Hamlet our deere Brothers death The memory be greene : and that it vs befitted To beare our hearts in greefe , and our whole Kingdome To be contracted in one brow of woe : Yet so farre hath Discretion fought with Nature , That we with wisest sorrow thinke on him , Together with remembrance of our selues . Therefore our sometimes Sister , now our Queene , Th ' imperiall Ioyntresse of this warlike State , Haue we , as ' twere , with a defeated ioy , With one Auspicious , and one Dropping eye , With mirth in Funerall , and with Dirge in Marriage , In equall Scale weighing Delight and Dole Taken to Wife ; nor haue we heerein barr ' d Your better Wisedomes , which haue freely gone With this affaire along , for all our Thankes . Now followes , that you know young Fortinbras , Holding a weake supposall of our worth ; Or thinking by our late deere Brothers death , Our State to be disioynt , and out of Frame , Colleagued with the dreame of his Aduantage ; He hath not fayl ' d to pester vs with Message , Importing the surrender of those Lands Lost by his Father : with all Bonds of Law To our most valiant Brother . So much for him . Enter Voltemand and Cornelius . Now for our selfe , and for this time of meeting Thus much the businesse is . We haue heere writ To Norway , Vncle of young Fortinbras , Who Impotent and Bedrid , scarsely heares Of this his Nephewes purpose , to suppresse His further gate heerein . In that the Leuies , The Lists , and full proportions are all made Out of his subiect : and we heere dispatch You good Cornelius , and you Voltemand , For bearing of this greeting to old Norway , Giuing to you no further personall power To businesse with the King , more then the scope Of these dilated Articles allow : Farewell , and let your hast commend your duty Volt . In that , and all things , will we shew our duty King . We doubt it nothing , heartily farewell . Exit Voltemand and Cornelius . And now Laertes , what ' s the newes with you ? You told vs of some suite . What is ' t Laertes ? You cannot speake of Reason to the Dane , And loose your voyce . What would ' st thou beg Laertes , That shall not be my Offer , not thy Asking ? The Head is not more Natiue to the Heart , The Hand more instrumentall to the Mouth , Then is the Throne of Denmarke to thy Father . What would ' st thou haue Laertes ? Laer . Dread my Lord , Your leaue and fauour to returne to France , From whence , though willingly I came to Denmarke To shew my duty in your Coronation , Yet now I must confesse , that duty done , My thoughts and wishes bend againe towards France , And bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon King . Haue you your Fathers leaue ? What sayes Pollonius ? Pol . He hath my Lord : I do beseech you giue him leaue to go King . Take thy faire houre Laertes , time be thine , And thy best graces spend it at thy will : But now my Cosin Hamlet , and my Sonne ? Ham . A little more then kin , and lesse then kinde King . How is it that the Clouds still hang on you ? Ham . Not so my Lord , I am too much i ' th ' Sun Queen . Good Hamlet cast thy nightly colour off , And let thine eye looke like a Friend on Denmarke . Do not for euer with thy veyled lids Seeke for thy Noble Father in the dust ; Thou know ' st ' tis common , all that liues must dye , Passing through Nature , to Eternity Ham . I Madam , it is common Queen . If it be ; Why seemes it so particular with thee Ham . Seemes Madam ? Nay , it is : I know not Seemes : ' Tis not alone my Inky Cloake ( good Mother ) Nor Customary suites of solemne Blacke , Nor windy suspiration of forc ' d breath , No , nor the fruitfull Riuer in the Eye , Nor the deiected hauiour of the Visage , Together with all Formes , Moods , shewes of Griefe , That can denote me truly . These indeed Seeme , For they are actions that a man might play : But I haue that Within , which passeth show ; These , but the Trappings , and the Suites of woe King . ' Tis sweet and commendable In your Nature Hamlet , To giue these mourning duties to your Father : But you must know , your Father lost a Father , That Father lost , lost his , and the Suruiuer bound In filiall Obligation , for some terme To do obsequious Sorrow . But to perseuer In obstinate Condolement , is a course Of impious stubbornnesse . ' Tis vnmanly greefe , It shewes a will most incorrect to Heauen , A Heart vnfortified , a Minde impatient , An Vnderstanding simple , and vnschool ' d : For , what we know must be , and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sence , Why should we in our peeuish Opposition Take it to heart ? Fye , ' tis a fault to Heauen , A fault against the Dead , a fault to Nature , To Reason most absurd , whose common Theame Is death of Fathers , and who still hath cried , From the first Coarse , till he that dyed to day , This must be so . We pray you throw to earth This vnpreuayling woe , and thinke of vs As of a Father ; For let the world take note , You are the most immediate to our Throne , And with no lesse Nobility of Loue , Then that which deerest Father beares his Sonne , Do I impart towards you . For your intent In going backe to Schoole in Wittenberg , It is most retrograde to our desire : And we beseech you , bend you to remaine Heere in the cheere and comfort of our eye , Our cheefest Courtier Cosin , and our Sonne Qu . Let not thy Mother lose her Prayers Hamlet : I prythee stay with vs , go not to Wittenberg Ham . I shall in all my best Obey you Madam King . Why ' tis a louing , and a faire Reply , Be as our selfe in Denmarke . Madam come , This gentle and vnforc ' d accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart ; in grace whereof , No iocond health that Denmarke drinkes to day , But the great Cannon to the Clowds shall tell , And the Kings Rouce , the Heauens shall bruite againe , Respeaking earthly Thunder . Come away . Exeunt . Manet Hamlet . Ham . Oh that this too too solid Flesh , would melt , Thaw , and resolue it selfe into a Dew : Or that the Euerlasting had not fixt His Cannon ' gainst Selfe - slaughter . O God , O God ! How weary , stale , flat , and vnprofitable Seemes to me all the vses of this world ? Fie on ' t ? Oh fie , fie , ' tis an vnweeded Garden That growes to Seed : Things rank , and grosse in Nature Possesse it meerely . That it should come to this : But two months dead : Nay , not so much ; not two , So excellent a King , that was to this Hiperion to a Satyre : so louing to my Mother , That he might not beteene the windes of heauen Visit her face too roughly . Heauen and Earth Must I remember : why she would hang on him , As if encrease of Appetite had growne By what is fed on ; and yet within a month ? Let me not thinke on ' t : Frailty , thy name is woman . A little Month , or ere those shooes were old , With which she followed my poore Fathers body Like Niobe , all teares . Why she , euen she . ( O Heauen ! A beast that wants discourse of Reason Would haue mourn ' d longer ) married with mine Vnkle , My Fathers Brother : but no more like my Father , Then I to Hercules . Within a Moneth ? Ere yet the salt of most vnrighteous Teares Had left the flushing of her gauled eyes , She married . O most wicked speed , to post With such dexterity to Incestuous sheets : It is not , nor it cannot come to good . But breake my heart , for I must hold my tongue . Enter Horatio , Barnardo , and Marcellus . Hor . Haile to your Lordship Ham . I am glad to see you well : Horatio , or I do forget my selfe Hor . The same my Lord , And your poore Seruant euer Ham . Sir my good friend , Ile change that name with you : And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio ? Marcellus Mar . My good Lord Ham . I am very glad to see you : good euen Sir . But what in faith make you from Wittemberge ? Hor . A truant disposition , good my Lord Ham . I would not haue your Enemy say so ; Nor shall you doe mine eare that violence , To make it truster of your owne report Against your selfe . I know you are no Truant : But what is your affaire in Elsenour ? Wee ' l teach you to drinke deepe , ere you depart Hor . My Lord , I came to see your Fathers Funerall Ham . I pray thee doe not mock me ( fellow Student ) I thinke it was to see my Mothers Wedding Hor . Indeed my Lord , it followed hard vpon Ham . Thrift thrift Horatio : the Funerall Bakt - meats Did coldly furnish forth the Marriage Tables ; Would I had met my dearest foe in heauen , Ere I had euer seene that day Horatio . My father , me thinkes I see my father Hor . Oh where my Lord ? Ham . In my minds eye ( Horatio ) Hor . I saw him once ; he was a goodly King Ham . He was a man , take him for all in all : I shall not look vpon his like againe Hor . My Lord , I thinke I saw him yesternight Ham . Saw ? Who ? Hor . My Lord , the King your Father Ham . The King my Father ? Hor . Season your admiration for a while With an attent eare ; till I may deliuer Vpon the witnesse of these Gentlemen , This maruell to you Ham . For Heauens loue let me heare Hor . Two nights together , had these Gentlemen ( Marcellus and Barnardo ) on their Watch In the dead wast and middle of the night Beene thus encountred . A figure like your Father , Arm ' d at all points exactly , Cap a Pe , Appeares before them , and with sollemne march Goes slow and stately : By them thrice he walkt , By their opprest and feare - surprized eyes , Within his Truncheons length ; whilst they bestil ' d Almost to Ielly with the Act of feare , Stand dumbe and speake not to him . This to me In dreadfull secrecie impart they did , And I with them the third Night kept the Watch , Whereas they had deliuer ' d both in time , Forme of the thing ; each word made true and good , The Apparition comes . I knew your Father : These hands are not more like Ham . But where was this ? Mar . My Lord vpon the platforme where we watcht Ham . Did you not speake to it ? Hor . My Lord , I did ; But answere made it none : yet once me thought It lifted vp it head , and did addresse It selfe to motion , like as it would speake : But euen then , the Morning Cocke crew lowd ; And at the sound it shrunke in hast away , And vanisht from our sight Ham . Tis very strange Hor . As I doe liue my honourd Lord ' tis true ; And we did thinke it writ downe in our duty To let you know of it Ham . Indeed , indeed Sirs ; but this troubles me . Hold you the watch to Night ? Both . We doe my Lord Ham . Arm ' d , say you ? Both . Arm ' d , my Lord Ham . From top to toe ? Both . My Lord , from head to foote Ham . Then saw you not his face ? Hor . O yes , my Lord , he wore his Beauer vp Ham . What , lookt he frowningly ? Hor . A countenance more in sorrow then in anger Ham . Pale , or red ? Hor . Nay very pale Ham . And fixt his eyes vpon you ? Hor . Most constantly Ham . I would I had beene there Hor . It would haue much amaz ' d you Ham . Very like , very like : staid it long ? Hor . While one with moderate hast might tell a hundred All . Longer , longer Hor . Not when I saw ' t Ham . His Beard was grisly ? no Hor . It was , as I haue seene it in his life , A Sable Siluer ' d Ham . Ile watch to Night ; perchance ' twill wake againe Hor . I warrant you it will Ham . If it assume my noble Fathers person , Ile speake to it , though Hell it selfe should gape And bid me hold my peace . I pray you all , If you haue hitherto conceald this sight ; Let it bee treble in your silence still : And whatsoeuer els shall hap to night , Giue it an vnderstanding but no tongue ; I will requite your loues ; so fare ye well : Vpon the Platforme twixt eleuen and twelue , Ile visit you All . Our duty to your Honour . Exeunt Ham . Your loue , as mine to you : farewell . My Fathers Spirit in Armes ? All is not well : I doubt some foule play : would the Night were come ; Till then sit still my soule ; foule deeds will rise , Though all the earth orewhelm them to mens eies . Enter . Scena Tertia Enter Laertes and Ophelia . Laer . My necessaries are imbark ' t ; Farewell : And Sister , as the Winds giue Benefit , And Conuoy is assistant ; doe not sleepe , But let me heare from you Ophel . Doe you doubt that ? Laer . For Hamlet , and the trifling of his fauours , Hold it a fashion and a toy in Bloude ; A Violet in the youth of Primy Nature ; Froward , not permanent ; sweet not lasting The suppliance of a minute ? No more Ophel . No more but so Laer . Thinke it no more : For nature cressant does not grow alone , In thewes and Bulke : but as his Temple waxes , The inward seruice of the Minde and Soule Growes wide withall . Perhaps he loues you now , And now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch The vertue of his feare : but you must feare His greatnesse weigh ' d , his will is not his owne ; For hee himselfe is subiect to his Birth : Hee may not , as vnuallued persons doe , Carue for himselfe ; for , on his choyce depends The sanctity and health of the whole State . And therefore must his choyce be circumscrib ' d Vnto the voyce and yeelding of that Body , Whereof he is the Head . Then if he sayes he loues you , It fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it ; As he in his peculiar Sect and force May giue his saying deed : which is no further , Then the maine voyce of Denmarke goes withall . Then weight what losse your Honour may sustaine , If with too credent eare you list his Songs ; Or lose your Heart ; or your chast Treasure open To his vnmastred importunity . Feare it Ophelia , feare it my deare Sister , And keepe within the reare of your Affection ; Out of the shot and danger of Desire . The chariest Maid is Prodigall enough , If she vnmaske her beauty to the Moone : Vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes , The Canker Galls , the Infants of the Spring Too oft before the buttons be disclos ' d , And in the Morne and liquid dew of Youth , Contagious blastments are most imminent . Be wary then , best safety lies in feare ; Youth to it selfe rebels , though none else neere Ophe . I shall th ' effect of this good Lesson keepe , As watchmen to my heart : but good my Brother Doe not as some vngracious Pastors doe , Shew me the steepe and thorny way to Heauen ; Whilst like a puft and recklesse Libertine Himselfe , the Primrose path of dalliance treads , And reaks not his owne reade Laer . Oh , feare me not . Enter Polonius . I stay too long ; but here my Father comes : A double blessing is a double grace ; Occasion smiles vpon a second leaue Polon . Yet heere Laertes ? Aboord , aboord for shame , The winde sits in the shoulder of your saile , And you are staid for there : my blessing with you ; And these few Precepts in thy memory , See thou Character . Giue thy thoughts no tongue , Nor any vnproportion ' d thoughts his Act : Be thou familiar ; but by no meanes vulgar : The friends thou hast , and their adoption tride , Grapple them to thy Soule , with hoopes of Steele : But doe not dull thy palme , with entertainment Of each vnhatch ' t , vnfledg ' d Comrade . Beware Of entrance to a quarrell : but being in Bear ' t that th ' opposed may beware of thee . Giue euery man thine eare ; but few thy voyce : Take each mans censure ; but reserue thy iudgement : Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy ; But not exprest in fancie ; rich , not gawdie : For the Apparell oft proclaimes the man . And they in France of the best ranck and station , Are of a most select and generous cheff in that . Neither a borrower , nor a lender be ; For lone oft loses both it selfe and friend : And borrowing duls the edge of Husbandry . This aboue all ; to thine owne selfe be true : And it must follow , as the Night the Day , Thou canst not then be false to any man . Farewell : my Blessing season this in thee Laer . Most humbly doe I take my leaue , my Lord Polon . The time inuites you , goe , your seruants tend Laer . Farewell Ophelia , and remember well What I haue said to you Ophe . Tis in my memory lockt , And you your selfe shall keepe the key of it Laer . Farewell . Exit Laer . Polon . What ist Ophelia he hath said to you ? Ophe . So please you , somthing touching the L [ ord ]. Hamlet Polon . Marry , well bethought : Tis told me he hath very oft of late Giuen priuate time to you ; and you your selfe Haue of your audience beene most free and bounteous . If it be so , as so tis put on me ; And that in way of caution : I must tell you , You doe not vnderstand your selfe so cleerely , As it behoues my Daughter , and your Honour . What is betweene you , giue me vp the truth ? Ophe . He hath my Lord of late , made many tenders Of his affection to me Polon . Affection , puh . You speake like a greene Girle , Vnsifted in such perillous Circumstance . Doe you beleeue his tenders , as you call them ? Ophe . I do not know , my Lord , what I should thinke Polon . Marry Ile teach you ; thinke your selfe a Baby , That you haue tane his tenders for true pay , Which are not starling . Tender your selfe more dearly ; Or not to crack the winde of the poore Phrase , Roaming it thus , you ' l tender me a foole Ophe . My Lord , he hath importun ' d me with loue , In honourable fashion Polon . I , fashion you may call it , go too , go too Ophe . And hath giuen countenance to his speech , My Lord , with all the vowes of Heauen Polon . I , Springes to catch Woodcocks . I doe know When the Bloud burnes , how Prodigall the Soule Giues the tongue vowes : these blazes , Daughter , Giuing more light then heate ; extinct in both , Euen in their promise , as it is a making ; You must not take for fire . For this time Daughter , Be somewhat scanter of your Maiden presence ; Set your entreatments at a higher rate , Then a command to parley . For Lord Hamlet , Beleeue so much in him , that he is young , And with a larger tether may he walke , Then may be giuen you . In few , Ophelia , Doe not beleeue his vowes ; for they are Broakers , Not of the eye , which their Inuestments show : But meere implorators of vnholy Sutes , Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds , The better to beguile . This is for all : I would not , in plaine tearmes , from this time forth , Haue you so slander any moment leisure , As to giue words or talke with the Lord Hamlet : Looke too ' t , I charge you ; come your wayes Ophe . I shall obey my Lord . Exeunt . Enter Hamlet , Horatio , Marcellus . Ham . The Ayre bites shrewdly : is it very cold ? Hor . It is a nipping and an eager ayre Ham . What hower now ? Hor . I thinke it lacks of twelue Mar . No , it is strooke Hor . Indeed I heard it not : then it drawes neere the season , Wherein the Spirit held his wont to walke . What does this meane my Lord ? Ham . The King doth wake to night , and takes his rouse , Keepes wassels and the swaggering vpspring reeles , And as he dreines his draughts of Renish downe , The kettle Drum and Trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his Pledge Horat . Is it a custome ? Ham . I marry ist ; And to my mind , though I am natiue heere , And to the manner borne : It is a Custome More honour ' d in the breach , then the obseruance . Enter Ghost . Hor . Looke my Lord , it comes Ham . Angels and Ministers of Grace defend vs : Be thou a Spirit of health , or Goblin damn ' d , Bring with thee ayres from Heauen , or blasts from Hell , Be thy euents wicked or charitable , Thou com ' st in such a questionable shape That I will speake to thee . Ile call thee Hamlet , King , Father , Royall Dane : Oh , oh , answer me , Let me not burst in Ignorance ; but tell Why thy Canoniz ' d bones Hearsed in death , Haue burst their cerments , why the Sepulcher Wherein we saw thee quietly enurn ' d , Hath op ' d his ponderous and Marble iawes , To cast thee vp againe ? What may this meane ? That thou dead Coarse againe in compleat steele , Reuisits thus the glimpses of the Moone , Making Night hidious ? And we fooles of Nature , So horridly to shake our disposition , With thoughts beyond thee ; reaches of our Soules , Say , why is this ? wherefore ? what should we doe ? Ghost beckens Hamlet . Hor . It beckons you to goe away with it , As if it some impartment did desire To you alone Mar . Looke with what courteous action It wafts you to a more remoued ground : But doe not goe with it Hor . No , by no meanes Ham . It will not speake : then will I follow it Hor . Doe not my Lord Ham . Why , what should be the feare ? I doe not set my life at a pins fee ; And for my Soule , what can it doe to that ? Being a thing immortall as it selfe : It waues me forth againe ; Ile follow it Hor . What if it tempt you toward the Floud my Lord ? Or to the dreadfull Sonnet of the Cliffe , That beetles o ' re his base into the Sea , And there assumes some other horrible forme , Which might depriue your Soueraignty of Reason , And draw you into madnesse thinke of it ? Ham . It wafts me still : goe on , Ile follow thee Mar . You shall not goe my Lord Ham . Hold off your hand Hor . Be rul ' d , you shall not goe Ham . My fate cries out , And makes each petty Artire in this body , As hardy as the Nemian Lions nerue : Still am I cal ' d ? Vnhand me Gentlemen : By Heau ' n , Ile make a Ghost of him that lets me : I say away , goe on , Ile follow thee . Exeunt . Ghost & Hamlet . Hor . He waxes desperate with imagination Mar . Let ' s follow ; ' tis not fit thus to obey him Hor . Haue after , to what issue will this come ? Mar . Something is rotten in the State of Denmarke Hor . Heauen will direct it Mar . Nay , let ' s follow him . Exeunt . Enter Ghost and Hamlet . Ham . Where wilt thou lead me ? speak ; Ile go no further Gho . Marke me Ham . I will Gho . My hower is almost come , When I to sulphurous and tormenting Flames Must render vp my selfe Ham . Alas poore Ghost Gho . Pitty me not , but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall vnfold Ham . Speake , I am bound to heare Gho . So art thou to reuenge , when thou shalt heare Ham . What ? Gho . I am thy Fathers Spirit , Doom ' d for a certaine terme to walke the night ; And for the day confin ' d to fast in Fiers , Till the foule crimes done in my dayes of Nature Are burnt and purg ' d away ? But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my Prison - House ; I could a Tale vnfold , whose lightest word Would harrow vp thy soule , freeze thy young blood , Make thy two eyes like Starres , start from their Spheres , Thy knotty and combined lockes to part , And each particular haire to stand an end , Like Quilles vpon the fretfull Porpentine : But this eternall blason must not be To eares of flesh and bloud ; list Hamlet , oh list , If thou didst euer thy deare Father loue Ham . Oh Heauen ! Gho . Reuenge his foule and most vnnaturall Murther Ham . Murther ? Ghost . Murther most foule , as in the best it is ; But this most foule , strange , and vnnaturall Ham . Hast , hast me to know it , That with wings as swift As meditation , or the thoughts of Loue , May sweepe to my Reuenge Ghost . I finde thee apt , And duller should ' st thou be then the fat weede That rots it selfe in ease , on Lethe Wharfe , Would ' st thou not stirre in this . Now Hamlet heare : It ' s giuen out , that sleeping in mine Orchard , A Serpent stung me : so the whole eare of Denmarke , Is by a forged processe of my death Rankly abus ' d : But know thou Noble youth , The Serpent that did sting thy Fathers life , Now weares his Crowne Ham . O my Propheticke soule : mine Vncle ? Ghost . I that incestuous , that adulterate Beast With witchcraft of his wits , hath Traitorous guifts . Oh wicked Wit , and Gifts , that haue the power So to seduce ? Won to this shamefull Lust The will of my most seeming vertuous Queene : Oh Hamlet , what a falling off was there , From me , whose loue was of that dignity , That it went hand in hand , euen with the Vow I made to her in Marriage ; and to decline Vpon a wretch , whose Naturall gifts were poore To those of mine . But Vertue , as it neuer wil be moued , Though Lewdnesse court it in a shape of Heauen : So Lust , though to a radiant Angell link ' d , Will sate it selfe in a Celestiall bed , & prey on Garbage . But soft , me thinkes I sent the Mornings Ayre ; Briefe let me be : Sleeping within mine Orchard , My custome alwayes in the afternoone ; Vpon my secure hower thy Vncle stole With iuyce of cursed Hebenon in a Violl , And in the Porches of mine eares did poure The leaperous Distilment ; whose effect Holds such an enmity with bloud of Man , That swift as Quick - siluer , it courses through The naturall Gates and Allies of the body ; And with a sodaine vigour it doth posset And curd , like Aygre droppings into Milke , The thin and wholsome blood : so did it mine ; And a most instant Tetter bak ' d about , Most Lazar - like , with vile and loathsome crust , All my smooth Body . Thus was I , sleeping , by a Brothers hand , Of Life , of Crowne , and Queene at once dispatcht ; Cut off euen in the Blossomes of my Sinne , Vnhouzzled , disappointed , vnnaneld , No reckoning made , but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head ; Oh horrible Oh horrible , most horrible : If thou hast nature in thee beare it not ; Let not the Royall Bed of Denmarke be A Couch for Luxury and damned Incest . But howsoeuer thou pursuest this Act , Taint not thy mind ; nor let thy Soule contriue Against thy Mother ought ; leaue her to heauen , And to those Thornes that in her bosome lodge , To pricke and sting her . Fare thee well at once ; The Glow - worme showes the Matine to be neere , And gins to pale his vneffectuall Fire : Adue , adue , Hamlet : remember me . Enter . Ham . Oh all you host of Heauen ! Oh Earth ; what els ? And shall I couple Hell ? Oh fie : hold my heart ; And you my sinnewes , grow not instant Old ; But beare me stiffely vp : Remember thee ? I , thou poore Ghost , while memory holds a seate In this distracted Globe : Remember thee ? Yea , from the Table of my Memory , Ile wipe away all triuiall fond Records , All sawes of Bookes , all formes , all presures past , That youth and obseruation coppied there ; And thy Commandment all alone shall liue Within the Booke and Volume of my Braine , Vnmixt with baser matter ; yes yes , by Heauen : Oh most pernicious woman ! Oh Villaine , Villaine , smiling damned Villaine ! My Tables , my Tables ; meet it is I set it downe , That one may smile , and smile and be a Villaine ; At least I ' m sure it may be so in Denmarke ; So Vnckle there you are : now to my word ; It is ; Adue , Adue , Remember me : I haue sworn ' t Hor . & Mar . within . My Lord , my Lord . Enter Horatio and Marcellus . Mar . Lord Hamlet Hor . Heauen secure him Mar . So be it Hor . Illo , ho , ho , my Lord Ham . Hillo , ho , ho , boy ; come bird , come Mar . How ist my Noble Lord ? Hor . What newes , my Lord ? Ham . Oh wonderfull ! Hor . Good my Lord tell it Ham . No you ' l reueale it Hor . Not I , my Lord , by Heauen Mar . Nor I , my Lord Ham . How say you then , would heart of man once think it ? But you ' l be secret ? Both . I , by Heau ' n , my Lord Ham . There ' s nere a villaine dwelling in all Denmarke But hee ' s an arrant knaue Hor . There needs no Ghost my Lord , come from the Graue , to tell vs this Ham . Why right , you are i ' th ' right ; And so , without more circumstance at all , I hold it fit that we shake hands , and part : You , as your busines and desires shall point you : For euery man ha ' s businesse and desire , Such as it is : and for mine owne poore part , Looke you , Ile goe pray Hor . These are but wild and hurling words , my Lord Ham . I ' m sorry they offend you heartily : Yes faith , heartily Hor . There ' s no offence my Lord Ham . Yes , by Saint Patricke , but there is my Lord , And much offence too , touching this Vision heere : It is an honest Ghost , that let me tell you : For your desire to know what is betweene vs , O ' remaster ' t as you may . And now good friends , As you are Friends , Schollers and Soldiers , Giue me one poore request Hor . What is ' t my Lord ? we will Ham . Neuer make known what you haue seen to night Both . My Lord , we will not Ham . Nay , but swear ' t Hor . Infaith my Lord , not I Mar . Nor I my Lord : in faith Ham . Vpon my sword Marcell . We haue sworne my Lord already Ham . Indeed , vpon my sword , Indeed Gho . Sweare . Ghost cries vnder the Stage . Ham . Ah ha boy , sayest thou so . Art thou there truepenny ? Come one you here this fellow in the selleredge Consent to sweare Hor . Propose the Oath my Lord Ham . Neuer to speake of this that you haue seene . Sweare by my sword Gho . Sweare Ham . Hic & vbique ? Then wee ' l shift for grownd , Come hither Gentlemen , And lay your hands againe vpon my sword , Neuer to speake of this that you haue heard : Sweare by my Sword Gho . Sweare Ham . Well said old Mole , can ' st worke i ' th ' ground so fast ? A worthy Pioner , once more remoue good friends Hor . Oh day and night : but this is wondrous strange Ham . And therefore as a stranger giue it welcome . There are more things in Heauen and Earth , Horatio , Then are dream ' t of in our Philosophy . But come , Here as before , neuer so helpe you mercy , How strange or odde so ere I beare my selfe ; ( As I perchance heereafter shall thinke meet To put an Anticke disposition on :) That you at such time seeing me , neuer shall With Armes encombred thus , or thus , head shake ; Or by pronouncing of some doubtfull Phrase ; As well , we know , or we could and if we would , Or if we list to speake ; or there be and if there might , Or such ambiguous giuing out to note , That you know ought of me ; this not to doe : So grace and mercy at your most neede helpe you : Sweare Ghost . Sweare Ham . Rest , rest perturbed Spirit : so Gentlemen , With all my loue I doe commend me to you ; And what so poore a man as Hamlet is , May doe t ' expresse his loue and friending to you , God willing shall not lacke : let vs goe in together , And still your fingers on your lippes I pray , The time is out of ioynt : Oh cursed spight , That euer I was borne to set it right . Nay , come let ' s goe together . Exeunt . Actus Secundus . Enter Polonius , and Reynoldo . Polon . Giue him his money , and these notes Reynoldo Reynol . I will my Lord Polon . You shall doe maruels wisely : good Reynoldo , Before you visite him you make inquiry Of his behauiour Reynol . My Lord , I did intend it Polon . Marry , well said ; Very well said . Looke you Sir , Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris ; And how , and who ; what meanes ; and where they keepe : What company , at what expence : and finding By this encompassement and drift of question , That they doe know my sonne : Come you more neerer Then your particular demands will touch it , Take you as ' twere some distant knowledge of him , And thus I know his father and his friends , And in part him . Doe you marke this Reynoldo ? Reynol . I , very well my Lord Polon . And in part him , but you may say not well ; But if ' t be hee I meane , hees very wilde ; Addicted so and so ; and there put on him What forgeries you please ; marry , none so ranke , As may dishonour him ; take heed of that : But Sir , such wanton , wild , and vsuall slips , As are Companions noted and most knowne To youth and liberty Reynol . As gaming my Lord Polon . I , or drinking , fencing , swearing , Quarelling , drabbing . You may goe so farre Reynol . My Lord that would dishonour him Polon . Faith no , as you may season it in the charge ; You must not put another scandall on him , That hee is open to Incontinencie ; That ' s not my meaning : but breath his faults so quaintly , That they may seeme the taints of liberty ; The flash and out - breake of a fiery minde , A sauagenes in vnreclaim ' d bloud of generall assault Reynol . But my good Lord Polon . Wherefore should you doe this ? Reynol . I my Lord , I would know that Polon . Marry Sir , heere ' s my drift , And I belieue it is a fetch of warrant : You laying these slight sulleyes on my Sonne , As ' twere a thing a little soil ' d i ' th ' working : Marke you your party in conuerse ; him you would sound , Hauing euer seene . In the prenominate crimes , The youth you breath of guilty , be assur ' d He closes with you in this consequence : Good sir , or so , or friend , or Gentleman . According to the Phrase and the Addition , Of man and Country Reynol . Very good my Lord Polon . And then Sir does he this ? He does : what was I about to say ? I was about say somthing : where did I leaue ? Reynol . At closes in the consequence : At friend , or so , and Gentleman Polon . At closes in the consequence , I marry , He closes with you thus . I know the Gentleman , I saw him yesterday , or tother day ; Or then or then , with such and such ; and as you say , There was he gaming , there o ' retooke in ' s Rouse , There falling out at Tennis ; or perchance , I saw him enter such a house of saile ; Videlicet , a Brothell , or so forth . See you now ; Your bait of falshood , takes this Cape of truth ; And thus doe we of wisedome and of reach With windlesses , and with assaies of Bias , By indirections finde directions out : So by my former Lecture and aduice Shall you my Sonne ; you haue me , haue you not ? Reynol . My Lord I haue Polon . God buy you ; fare you well Reynol . Good my Lord Polon . Obserue his inclination in your selfe Reynol . I shall my Lord Polon . And let him plye his Musicke Reynol . Well , my Lord . Enter . Enter Ophelia . Polon . Farewell : How now Ophelia , what ' s the matter ? Ophe . Alas my Lord , I haue beene so affrighted Polon . With what , in the name of Heauen ? Ophe . My Lord , as I was sowing in my Chamber , Lord Hamlet with his doublet all vnbrac ' d , No hat vpon his head , his stockings foul ' d , Vngartred , and downe giued to his Anckle , Pale as his shirt , his knees knocking each other , And with a looke so pitious in purport , As if he had been loosed out of hell , To speake of horrors : he comes before me Polon . Mad for thy Loue ? Ophe . My Lord , I doe not know : but truly I do feare it Polon . What said he ? Ophe . He tooke me by the wrist , and held me hard ; Then goes he to the length of all his arme ; And with his other hand thus o ' re his brow , He fals to such perusall of my face , As he would draw it . Long staid he so , At last , a little shaking of mine Arme : And thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe ; He rais ' d a sigh , so pittious and profound , That it did seeme to shatter all his bulke , And end his being . That done , he lets me goe , And with his head ouer his shoulders turn ' d , He seem ' d to finde his way without his eyes , For out adores he went without their helpe ; And to the last , bended their light on me Polon . Goe with me , I will goe seeke the King , This is the very extasie of Loue , Whose violent property foredoes it selfe , And leads the will to desperate Vndertakings , As oft as any passion vnder Heauen , That does afflict our Natures . I am sorrie , What haue you giuen him any hard words of late ? Ophe . No my good Lord : but as you did command , I did repell his Letters , and deny ' de His accesse to me Pol . That hath made him mad . I am sorrie that with better speed and iudgement I had not quoted him . I feare he did but trifle , And meant to wracke thee : but beshrew my iealousie : It seemes it is as proper to our Age , To cast beyond our selues in our Opinions , As it is common for the yonger sort To lacke discretion . Come , go we to the King , This must be knowne , being kept close might moue More greefe to hide , then hate to vtter loue . Exeunt . Scena Secunda . Enter King , Queene , Rosincrane , and Guildensterne Cum alijs . King . Welcome deere Rosincrance and Guildensterne . Moreouer , that we much did long to see you , The neede we haue to vse you , did prouoke Our hastie sending . Something haue you heard Of Hamlets transformation : so I call it , Since not th ' exterior , nor the inward man Resembles that it was . What it should bee More then his Fathers death , that thus hath put him So much from th ' vnderstanding of himselfe , I cannot deeme of . I intreat you both , That being of so young dayes brought vp with him : And since so Neighbour ' d to his youth , and humour , That you vouchsafe your rest heere in our Court Some little time : so by your Companies To draw him on to pleasures , and to gather So much as from Occasions you may gleane , That open ' d lies within our remedie Qu . Good Gentlemen , he hath much talk ' d of you , And sure I am , two men there are not liuing , To whom he more adheres . If it will please you To shew vs so much Gentrie , and good will , As to expend your time with vs a - while , For the supply and profit of our Hope , Your Visitation shall receiue such thankes As fits a Kings remembrance Rosin . Both your Maiesties Might by the Soueraigne power you haue of vs , Put your dread pleasures , more into Command Then to Entreatie Guil . We both obey , And here giue vp our selues , in the full bent , To lay our Seruices freely at your feete , To be commanded King . Thankes Rosincrance , and gentle Guildensterne Qu . Thankes Guildensterne and gentle Rosincrance . And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changed Sonne . Go some of ye , And bring the Gentlemen where Hamlet is Guil . Heauens make our presence and our practises Pleasant and helpfull to him . Enter . Queene . Amen . Enter Polonius . Pol . Th ' Ambassadors from Norwey , my good Lord , Are ioyfully return ' d King . Thou still hast bin the father of good Newes Pol . Haue I , my Lord ? Assure you , my good Liege , I hold my dutie , as I hold my Soule , Both to my God , one to my gracious King : And I do thinke , or else this braine of mine Hunts not the traile of Policie , so sure As I haue vs ' d to do : that I haue found The very cause of Hamlets Lunacie King . Oh speake of that , that I do long to heare Pol . Giue first admittance to th ' Ambassadors , My Newes shall be the Newes to that great Feast King . Thy selfe do grace to them , and bring them in . He tels me my sweet Queene , that he hath found The head and sourse of all your Sonnes distemper Qu . I doubt it is no other , but the maine , His Fathers death , and our o ' re - hasty Marriage . Enter Polonius , Voltumand , and Cornelius . King . Well , we shall sift him . Welcome good Frends : Say Voltumand , what from our Brother Norwey ? Volt . Most faire returne of Greetings , and Desires . Vpon our first , he sent out to suppresse His Nephewes Leuies , which to him appear ' d To be a preparation ' gainst the Poleak : But better look ' d into , he truly found It was against your Highnesse , whereat greeued , That so his Sicknesse , Age , and Impotence Was falsely borne in hand , sends out Arrests On Fortinbras , which he ( in breefe ) obeyes , Receiues rebuke from Norwey : and in fine , Makes Vow before his Vnkle , neuer more To giue th ' assay of Armes against your Maiestie . Whereon old Norwey , ouercome with ioy , Giues him three thousand Crownes in Annuall Fee , And his Commission to imploy those Soldiers So leuied as before , against the Poleak : With an intreaty heerein further shewne , That it might please you to giue quiet passe Through your Dominions , for his Enterprize , On such regards of safety and allowance , As therein are set downe King . It likes vs well : And at our more consider ' d time wee ' l read , Answer , and thinke vpon this Businesse . Meane time we thanke you , for your well - tooke Labour . Go to your rest , at night wee ' l Feast together . Most welcome home . Exit Ambass . Pol . This businesse is very well ended . My Liege , and Madam , to expostulate What Maiestie should be , what Dutie is , Why day is day ; night , night ; and time is time , Were nothing but to waste Night , Day , and Time . Therefore , since Breuitie is the Soule of Wit , And tediousnesse , the limbes and outward flourishes , I will be breefe . Your Noble Sonne is mad : Mad call I it ; for to define true Madnesse , What is ' t , but to be nothing else but mad . But let that go Qu . More matter , with lesse Art Pol . Madam , I sweare I vse no Art at all : That he is mad , ' tis true : ' Tis true ' tis pittie , And pittie it is true : A foolish figure , But farewell it : for I will vse no Art . Mad let vs grant him then : and now remaines That we finde out the cause of this effect , Or rather say , the cause of this defect ; For this effect defectiue , comes by cause , Thus it remaines , and the remainder thus . Perpend , I haue a daughter : haue , whil ' st she is mine , Who in her Dutie and Obedience , marke , Hath giuen me this : now gather , and surmise . The Letter . To the Celestiall , and my Soules Idoll , the most beautifed Ophelia . That ' s an ill Phrase , a vilde Phrase , beautified is a vilde Phrase : but you shall heare these in her excellent white bosome , these Qu . Came this from Hamlet to her Pol . Good Madam stay awhile , I will be faithfull . Doubt thou , the Starres are fire , Doubt , that the Sunne doth moue : Doubt Truth to be a Lier , But neuer Doubt , I loue . O deere Ophelia , I am ill at these Numbers : I haue not Art to reckon my grones ; but that I loue thee best , oh most Best beleeue it . Adieu . Thine euermore most deere Lady , whilst this Machine is to him , Hamlet . This in Obedience hath my daughter shew ' d me : And more aboue hath his soliciting , As they fell out by Time , by Meanes , and Place , All giuen to mine eare King . But how hath she receiu ' d his Loue ? Pol . What do you thinke of me ? King . As of a man , faithfull and Honourable Pol . I wold faine proue so . But what might you think ? When I had seene this hot loue on the wing , As I perceiued it , I must tell you that Before my Daughter told me what might you Or my deere Maiestie your Queene heere , think , If I had playd the Deske or Table - booke , Or giuen my heart a winking , mute and dumbe , Or look ' d vpon this Loue , with idle sight , What might you thinke ? No , I went round to worke , And ( my yong Mistris ) thus I did bespeake Lord Hamlet is a Prince out of thy Starre , This must not be : and then , I Precepts gaue her , That she should locke her selfe from his Resort , Admit no Messengers , receiue no Tokens : Which done , she tooke the Fruites of my Aduice , And he repulsed . A short Tale to make , Fell into a Sadnesse , then into a Fast , Thence to a Watch , thence into a Weaknesse , Thence to a Lightnesse , and by this declension Into the Madnesse whereon now he raues , And all we waile for King . Do you thinke ' tis this ? Qu . It may be very likely Pol . Hath there bene such a time , I ' de fain know that , That I haue possitiuely said , ' tis so , When it prou ' d otherwise ? King . Not that I know Pol . Take this from this ; if this be otherwise , If Circumstances leade me , I will finde Where truth is hid , though it were hid indeede Within the Center King . How may we try it further ? Pol . You know sometimes He walkes foure houres together , heere In the Lobby Qu . So he ha ' s indeed Pol . At such a time Ile loose my Daughter to him , Be you and I behinde an Arras then , Marke the encounter : If he loue her not , And be not from his reason falne thereon ; Let me be no Assistant for a State , And keepe a Farme and Carters King . We will try it . Enter Hamlet reading on a Booke . Qu . But looke where sadly the poore wretch Comes reading Pol . Away I do beseech you , both away , Ile boord him presently . Exit King & Queen . Oh giue me leaue . How does my good Lord Hamlet ? Ham . Well , God - a - mercy Pol . Do you know me , my Lord ? Ham . Excellent , excellent well : y ' are a Fishmonger Pol . Not I my Lord Ham . Then I would you were so honest a man Pol . Honest , my Lord ? Ham . I sir , to be honest as this world goes , is to bee one man pick ' d out of two thousand Pol . That ' s very true , my Lord Ham . For if the Sun breed Magots in a dead dogge , being a good kissing Carrion - Haue you a daughter ? Pol . I haue my Lord Ham . Let her not walke i ' thSunne : Conception is a blessing , but not as your daughter may conceiue . Friend looke too ' t Pol . How say you by that ? Still harping on my daughter : yet he knew me not at first ; he said I was a Fishmonger : he is farre gone , farre gone : and truly in my youth , I suffred much extreamity for loue : very neere this . Ile speake to him againe . What do you read my Lord ? Ham . Words , words , words Pol . What is the matter , my Lord ? Ham . Betweene who ? Pol . I meane the matter you meane , my Lord Ham . Slanders Sir : for the Satyricall slaue saies here , that old men haue gray Beards ; that their faces are wrinkled ; their eyes purging thicke Amber , or Plum - Tree Gumme : and that they haue a plentifull locke of Wit , together with weake Hammes . All which Sir , though I most powerfully , and potently beleeue ; yet I holde it not Honestie to haue it thus set downe : For you your selfe Sir , should be old as I am , if like a Crab you could go backward Pol . Though this be madnesse , Yet there is Method in ' t : will you walke Out of the ayre my Lord ? Ham . Into my Graue ? Pol . Indeed that is out o ' th ' Ayre : How pregnant ( sometimes ) his Replies are ? A happinesse , That often Madnesse hits on , Which Reason and Sanitie could not So prosperously be deliuer ' d of . I will leaue him , And sodainely contriue the meanes of meeting Betweene him , and my daughter . My Honourable Lord , I will most humbly Take my leaue of you Ham . You cannot Sir take from me any thing , that I will more willingly part withall , except my life , my life Polon . Fare you well my Lord Ham . These tedious old fooles Polon . You goe to seeke my Lord Hamlet ; there hee is . Enter Rosincran and Guildensterne . Rosin . God saue you Sir Guild . Mine honour ' d Lord ? Rosin . My most deare Lord ? Ham . My excellent good friends ? How do ' st thou Guildensterne ? Oh , Rosincrane ; good Lads : How doe ye both ? Rosin . As the indifferent Children of the earth Guild . Happy , in that we are not ouer - happy : on Fortunes Cap , we are not the very Button Ham . Nor the Soales of her Shoo ? Rosin . Neither my Lord Ham . Then you liue about her waste , or in the middle of her fauour ? Guil . Faith , her priuates , we Ham . In the secret parts of Fortune ? Oh , most true : she is a Strumpet . What ' s the newes ? Rosin . None my Lord ; but that the World ' s growne honest Ham . Then is Doomesday neere : But your newes is not true . Let me question more in particular : what haue you my good friends , deserued at the hands of Fortune , that she sends you to Prison hither ? Guil . Prison , my Lord ? Ham . Denmark ' s a Prison Rosin . Then is the World one Ham . A goodly one , in which there are many Confines , Wards , and Dungeons ; Denmarke being one o ' th ' worst Rosin . We thinke not so my Lord Ham . Why then ' tis none to you ; for there is nothing either good or bad , but thinking makes it so : to me it is a prison Rosin . Why then your Ambition makes it one : ' tis too narrow for your minde Ham . O God , I could be bounded in a nutshell , and count my selfe a King of infinite space ; were it not that I haue bad dreames Guil . Which dreames indeed are Ambition : for the very substance of the Ambitious , is meerely the shadow of a Dreame Ham . A dreame it selfe is but a shadow Rosin . Truely , and I hold Ambition of so ayry and light a quality , that it is but a shadowes shadow Ham . Then are our Beggers bodies ; and our Monarchs and out - stretcht Heroes the Beggers Shadowes : shall wee to th ' Court : for , by my fey I cannot reason ? Both . Wee ' l wait vpon you Ham . No such matter . I will not sort you with the rest of my seruants : for to speake to you like an honest man : I am most dreadfully attended ; but in the beaten way of friendship , What make you at Elsonower ? Rosin . To visit you my Lord , no other occasion Ham . Begger that I am , I am euen poore in thankes ; but I thanke you : and sure deare friends my thanks are too deare a halfepeny ; were you not sent for ? Is it your owne inclining ? Is it a free visitation ? Come , deale iustly with me : come , come ; nay speake Guil . What should we say my Lord ? Ham . Why any thing . But to the purpose ; you were sent for ; and there is a kinde confession in your lookes ; which your modesties haue not craft enough to color , I know the good King & Queene haue sent for you Rosin . To what end my Lord ? Ham . That you must teach me : but let mee coniure you by the rights of our fellowship , by the consonancy of our youth , by the Obligation of our euer - preserued loue , and by what more deare , a better proposer could charge you withall ; be euen and direct with me , whether you were sent for or no Rosin . What say you ? Ham . Nay then I haue an eye of you : if you loue me hold not off Guil . My Lord , we were sent for Ham . I will tell you why ; so shall my anticipation preuent your discouery of your secricie to the King and Queene : moult no feather , I haue of late , but wherefore I know not , lost all my mirth , forgone all custome of exercise ; and indeed , it goes so heauenly with my disposition ; that this goodly frame the Earth , seemes to me a sterrill Promontory ; this most excellent Canopy the Ayre , look you , this braue ore - hanging , this Maiesticall Roofe , fretted with golden fire : why , it appeares no other thing to mee , then a foule and pestilent congregation of vapours . What a piece of worke is a man ! how Noble in Reason ? how infinite in faculty ? in forme and mouing how expresse and admirable ? in Action , how like an Angel ? in apprehension , how like a God ? the beauty of the world , the Parragon of Animals ; and yet to me , what is this Quintessence of Dust ? Man delights not me ; no , nor Woman neither ; though by your smiling you seeme to say so Rosin . My Lord , there was no such stuffe in my thoughts Ham . Why did you laugh , when I said , Man delights not me ? Rosin . To thinke , my Lord , if you delight not in Man , what Lenton entertainment the Players shall receiue from you : wee coated them on the way , and hither are they comming to offer you Seruice Ham . He that playes the King shall be welcome ; his Maiesty shall haue Tribute of mee : the aduenturous Knight shal vse his Foyle and Target : the Louer shall not sigh gratis , the humorous man shall end his part in peace : the Clowne shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled a ' th ' sere : and the Lady shall say her minde freely ; or the blanke Verse shall halt for ' t : what Players are they ? Rosin . Euen those you were wont to take delight in the Tragedians of the City Ham . How chances it they trauaile ? their residence both in reputation and profit was better both wayes Rosin . I thinke their Inhibition comes by the meanes of the late Innouation ? Ham . Doe they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the City ? Are they so follow ' d ? Rosin . No indeed , they are not Ham . How comes it ? doe they grow rusty ? Rosin . Nay , their indeauour keepes in the wonted pace ; But there is Sir an ayrie of Children , little Yases , that crye out on the top of question ; and are most tyrannically clap ' t for ' t : these are now the fashion , and so be - ratled the common Stages ( so they call them ) that many wearing Rapiers , are affraide of Goose - quils , and dare scarse come thither Ham . What are they Children ? Who maintains ' em ? How are they escorted ? Will they pursue the Quality no longer then they can sing ? Will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselues to common Players ( as it is most like if their meanes are not better ) their Writers do them wrong , to make them exclaim against their owne Succession Rosin . Faith there ha ' s bene much to do on both sides : and the Nation holds it no sinne , to tarre them to Controuersie . There was for a while , no mony bid for argument , vnlesse the Poet and the Player went to Cuffes in the Question Ham . Is ' t possible ? Guild . Oh there ha ' s beene much throwing about of Braines Ham . Do the Boyes carry it away ? Rosin . I that they do my Lord . Hercules & his load too Ham . It is not strange : for mine Vnckle is King of Denmarke , and those that would make mowes at him while my Father liued ; giue twenty , forty , an hundred Ducates a peece , for his picture in Little . There is something in this more then Naturall , if Philosophie could finde it out . Flourish for the Players . Guil . There are the Players Ham . Gentlemen , you are welcom to Elsonower : your hands , come : The appurtenance of Welcome , is Fashion and Ceremony . Let me comply with you in the Garbe , lest my extent to the Players ( which I tell you must shew fairely outward ) should more appeare like entertainment then yours . You are welcome : but my Vnckle Father , and Aunt Mother are deceiu ' d Guil . In what my deere Lord ? Ham . I am but mad North , North - West : when the Winde is Southerly , I know a Hawke from a Handsaw . Enter Polonius . Pol . Well be with you Gentlemen Ham . Hearke you Guildensterne , and you too : at each eare a hearer : that great Baby you see there , is not yet out of his swathing clouts Rosin . Happily he ' s the second time come to them : for they say , an old man is twice a childe Ham . I will Prophesie . Hee comes to tell me of the Players . Mark it , you say right Sir : for a Monday morning ' twas so indeed Pol . My Lord , I haue Newes to tell you Ham . My Lord , I haue Newes to tell you . When Rossius an Actor in Rome - Pol . The Actors are come hither my Lord Ham . Buzze , buzze Pol . Vpon mine Honor Ham . Then can each Actor on his Asse - Polon . The best Actors in the world , either for Tragedie , Comedie , Historie , Pastorall : Pastoricall - Comicall - Historicall - Pastorall : Tragicall - Historicall : Tragicall - Comicall - Historicall - Pastorall : Scene indiuidible : or Poem vnlimited . Seneca cannot be too heauy , nor Plautus too light , for the law of Writ , and the Liberty . These are the onely men Ham . O Iephta Iudge of Israel , what a Treasure had ' st thou ? Pol . What a Treasure had he , my Lord ? Ham . Why one faire Daughter , and no more , The which he loued passing well Pol . Still on my Daughter Ham . Am I not i ' th ' right old Iephta ? Polon . If you call me Iephta my Lord , I haue a daughter that I loue passing well Ham . Nay that followes not Polon . What followes then , my Lord ? Ha . Why , As by lot , God wot : and then you know , It came to passe , as most like it was : The first rowe of the Pons Chanson will shew you more . For looke where my Abridgements come . Enter foure or fiue Players . Y ' are welcome Masters , welcome all . I am glad to see thee well : Welcome good Friends . Oh my olde Friend ? Thy face is valiant since I saw thee last : Com ' st thou to beard me in Denmarke ? What , my yong Lady and Mistris ? Byrlady your Ladiship is neerer Heauen then when I saw you last , by the altitude of a Choppine . Pray God your voice like a peece of vncurrant Gold be not crack ' d within the ring . Masters , you are all welcome : wee ' l e ' ne to ' t like French Faulconers , flie at any thing we see : wee ' l haue a Speech straight . Come giue vs a tast of your quality : come , a passionate speech 1 . Play . What speech , my Lord ? Ham . I heard thee speak me a speech once , but it was neuer Acted : or if it was , not aboue once , for the Play I remember pleas ' d not the Million , ' twas Cauiarie to the Generall : but it was ( as I receiu ' d it , and others , whose iudgement in such matters , cried in the top of mine ) an excellent Play ; well digested in the Scoenes , set downe with as much modestie , as cunning . I remember one said , there was no Sallets in the lines , to make the matter sauory ; nor no matter in the phrase , that might indite the Author of affectation , but cal ' d it an honest method . One cheefe Speech in it , I cheefely lou ' d , ' twas Aeneas Tale to Dido , and thereabout of it especially , where he speaks of Priams slaughter . If it liue in your memory , begin at this Line , let me see , let me see : The rugged Pyrrhus like th ' Hyrcanian Beast . It is not so : it begins with Pyrrhus The rugged Pyrrhus , he whose Sable Armes Blacke as his purpose , did the night resemble When he lay couched in the Ominous Horse , Hath now this dread and blacke Complexion smear ' d With Heraldry more dismall : Head to foote Now is he to take Geulles , horridly Trick ' d With blood of Fathers , Mothers , Daughters , Sonnes , Bak ' d and impasted with the parching streets , That lend a tyrannous , and damned light To their vilde Murthers , roasted in wrath and fire , And thus o ' re - sized with coagulate gore , With eyes like Carbuncles , the hellish Pyrrhus Olde Grandsire Priam seekes Pol . Fore God , my Lord , well spoken , with good accent , and good discretion 1 . Player . Anon he findes him , Striking too short at Greekes . His anticke Sword , Rebellious to his Arme , lyes where it falles Repugnant to command : vnequall match , Pyrrhus at Priam driues , in Rage strikes wide : But with the whiffe and winde of his fell Sword , Th ' vnnerued Father fals . Then senselesse Illium , Seeming to feele his blow , with flaming top Stoopes to his Bace , and with a hideous crash Takes Prisoner Pyrrhus eare . For loe , his Sword Which was declining on the Milkie head Of Reuerend Priam , seem ' d i ' th ' Ayre to sticke : So as a painted Tyrant Pyrrhus stood , And like a Newtrall to his will and matter , did nothing . But as we often see against some storme , A silence in the Heauens , the Racke stand still , The bold windes speechlesse , and the Orbe below As hush as death : Anon the dreadfull Thunder Doth rend the Region . So after Pyrrhus pause , A rowsed Vengeance sets him new a - worke , And neuer did the Cyclops hammers fall On Mars his Armours , forg ' d for proofe Eterne , With lesse remorse then Pyrrhus bleeding sword Now falles on Priam . Out , out , thou Strumpet - Fortune , all you Gods , In generall Synod take away her power : Breake all the Spokes and Fallies from her wheele , And boule the round Naue downe the hill of Heauen , As low as to the Fiends Pol . This is too long Ham . It shall to ' th Barbars , with your beard . Prythee say on : He ' s for a Iigge , or a tale of Baudry , or hee sleepes . Say on ; come to Hecuba 1 . Play . But who , O who , had seen the inobled Queen Ham . The inobled Queene ? Pol . That ' s good : Inobled Queene is good 1 . Play . Run bare - foot vp and downe , Threatning the flame With Bisson Rheume : A clout about that head , Where late the Diadem stood , and for a Robe About her lanke and all ore - teamed Loines , A blanket in th ' Alarum of feare caught vp . Who this had seene , with tongue in Venome steep ' d , ' Gainst Fortunes State , would Treason haue pronounc ' d ? But if the Gods themselues did see her then , When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport In mincing with his Sword her Husbands limbes , The instant Burst of Clamour that she made ( Vnlesse things mortall moue them not at all ) Would haue made milche the Burning eyes of Heauen , And passion in the Gods Pol . Looke where he ha ' s not turn ' d his colour , and ha ' s teares in ' s eyes . Pray you no more Ham . ' Tis well , Ile haue thee speake out the rest , soone . Good my Lord , will you see the Players wel bestow ' d . Do ye heare , let them be well vs ' d : for they are the Abstracts and breefe Chronicles of the time . After your death , you were better haue a bad Epitaph , then their ill report while you liued Pol . My Lord , I will vse them according to their desart Ham . Gods bodykins man , better . Vse euerie man after his desart , and who should scape whipping : vse them after your own Honor and Dignity . The lesse they deserue , the more merit is in your bountie . Take them in Pol . Come sirs . Exit Polon . Ham . Follow him Friends : wee ' l heare a play to morrow . Dost thou heare me old Friend , can you play the murther of Gonzago ? Play . I my Lord Ham . Wee ' l ha ' t to morrow night . You could for a need study a speech of some dosen or sixteene lines , which I would set downe , and insert in ' t ? Could ye not ? Play . I my Lord Ham . Very well . Follow that Lord , and looke you mock him not . My good Friends , Ile leaue you til night you are welcome to Elsonower ? Rosin . Good my Lord . Exeunt . Manet Hamlet . Ham . I so , God buy ' ye : Now I am alone . Oh what a Rogue and Pesant slaue am I ? Is it not monstrous that this Player heere , But in a Fixion , in a dreame of Passion , Could force his soule so to his whole conceit , That from her working , all his visage warm ' d ; Teares in his eyes , distraction in ' s Aspect , A broken voyce , and his whole Function suiting With Formes , to his Conceit ? And all for nothing ? For Hecuba ? What ' s Hecuba to him , or he to Hecuba , That he should weepe for her ? What would he doe , Had he the Motiue and the Cue for passion That I haue ? He would drowne the Stage with teares , And cleaue the generall eare with horrid speech : Make mad the guilty , and apale the free , Confound the ignorant , and amaze indeed , The very faculty of Eyes and Eares . Yet I , A dull and muddy - metled Rascall , peake Like Iohn a - dreames , vnpregnant of my cause , And can say nothing : No , not for a King , Vpon whose property , and most deere life , A damn ' d defeate was made . Am I a Coward ? Who calles me Villaine ? breakes my pate a - crosse ? Pluckes off my Beard , and blowes it in my face ? Tweakes me by ' th ' Nose ? giues me the Lye i ' th ' Throate , As deepe as to the Lungs ? Who does me this ? Ha ? Why I should take it : for it cannot be , But I am Pigeon - Liuer ' d , and lacke Gall To make Oppression bitter , or ere this , I should haue fatted all the Region Kites With this Slaues Offall , bloudy : a Bawdy villaine , Remorselesse , Treacherous , Letcherous , kindles villaine ! Oh Vengeance ! Who ? What an Asse am I ? I sure , this is most braue , That I , the Sonne of the Deere murthered , Prompted to my Reuenge by Heauen , and Hell , Must ( like a Whore ) vnpacke my heart with words , And fall a Cursing like a very Drab . A Scullion ? Fye vpon ' t : Foh . About my Braine . I haue heard , that guilty Creatures sitting at a Play , Haue by the very cunning of the Scoene , Bene strooke so to the soule , that presently They haue proclaim ' d their Malefactions . For Murther , though it haue no tongue , will speake With most myraculous Organ . Ile haue these Players , Play something like the murder of my Father , Before mine Vnkle . Ile obserue his lookes , Ile rent him to the quicke : If he but blench I know my course . The Spirit that I haue seene May be the Diuell , and the Diuel hath power T ' assume a pleasing shape , yea and perhaps Out of my Weaknesse , and my Melancholly , As he is very potent with such Spirits , Abuses me to damne me . Ile haue grounds More Relatiue then this : The Play ' s the thing , Wherein Ile catch the Conscience of the King . Exit Enter King , Queene , Polonius , Ophelia , Rosincrance , Guildenstern , and Lords . King . And can you by no drift of circumstance Get from him why he puts on this Confusion : Grating so harshly all his dayes of quiet With turbulent and dangerous Lunacy Rosin . He does confesse he feeles himselfe distracted , But from what cause he will by no meanes speake Guil . Nor do we finde him forward to be sounded , But with a crafty Madnesse keepes aloofe : When we would bring him on to some Confession Of his true state Qu . Did he receiue you well ? Rosin . Most like a Gentleman Guild . But with much forcing of his disposition Rosin . Niggard of question , but of our demands Most free in his reply Qu . Did you assay him to any pastime ? Rosin . Madam , it so fell out , that certaine Players We ore - wrought on the way : of these we told him , And there did seeme in him a kinde of ioy To heare of it : They are about the Court , And ( as I thinke ) they haue already order This night to play before him Pol . ' Tis most true : And he beseech ' d me to intreate your Maiesties To heare , and see the matter King . With all my heart , and it doth much content me To heare him so inclin ' d . Good Gentlemen , Giue him a further edge , and driue his purpose on To these delights Rosin . We shall my Lord . Exeunt . King . Sweet Gertrude leaue vs too , For we haue closely sent for Hamlet hither , That he , as ' twere by accident , may there Affront Ophelia . Her Father , and my selfe ( lawful espials ) Will so bestow our selues , that seeing vnseene We may of their encounter frankely iudge , And gather by him , as he is behaued , If ' t be th ' affliction of his loue , or no . That thus he suffers for Qu . I shall obey you , And for your part Ophelia , I do wish That your good Beauties be the happy cause Of Hamlets wildenesse : so shall I hope your Vertues Will bring him to his wonted way againe , To both your Honors Ophe . Madam , I wish it may Pol . Ophelia , walke you heere . Gracious so please ye We will bestow our selues : Reade on this booke , That shew of such an exercise may colour Your lonelinesse . We are oft too blame in this , ' Tis too much prou ' d , that with Deuotions visage , And pious Action , we do surge o ' re The diuell himselfe King . Oh ' tis true : How smart a lash that speech doth giue my Conscience ? The Harlots Cheeke beautied with plaist ' ring Art Is not more vgly to the thing that helpes it , Then is my deede , to my most painted word . Oh heauie burthen ! Pol . I heare him comming , let ' s withdraw my Lord . Exeunt . Enter Hamlet . Ham . To be , or not to be , that is the Question : Whether ' tis Nobler in the minde to suffer The Slings and Arrowes of outragious Fortune , Or to take Armes against a Sea of troubles , And by opposing end them : to dye , to sleepe No more ; and by a sleepe , to say we end The Heart - ake , and the thousand Naturall shockes That Flesh is heyre too ? ' Tis a consummation Deuoutly to be wish ' d . To dye to sleepe , To sleepe , perchance to Dreame ; I , there ' s the rub , For in that sleepe of death , what dreames may come , When we haue shuffel ' d off this mortall coile , Must giue vs pawse . There ' s the respect That makes Calamity of so long life : For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time , The Oppressors wrong , the poore mans Contumely , The pangs of dispriz ' d Loue , the Lawes delay , The insolence of Office , and the Spurnes That patient merit of the vnworthy takes , When he himselfe might his Quietus make With a bare Bodkin ? Who would these Fardles beare To grunt and sweat vnder a weary life , But that the dread of something after death , The vndiscouered Countrey , from whose Borne No Traueller returnes , Puzels the will , And makes vs rather beare those illes we haue , Then flye to others that we know not of . Thus Conscience does make Cowards of vs all , And thus the Natiue hew of Resolution Is sicklied o ' re , with the pale cast of Thought , And enterprizes of great pith and moment , With this regard their Currants turne away , And loose the name of Action . Soft you now , The faire Ophelia ? Nimph , in thy Orizons Be all my sinnes remembred Ophe . Good my Lord , How does your Honor for this many a day ? Ham . I humbly thanke you : well , well , well Ophe . My Lord , I haue Remembrances of yours , That I haue longed long to re - deliuer . I pray you now , receiue them Ham . No , no , I neuer gaue you ought Ophe . My honor ' d Lord , I know right well you did , And with them words of so sweet breath compos ' d , As made the things more rich , then perfume left : Take these againe , for to the Noble minde Rich gifts wax poore , when giuers proue vnkinde . There my Lord Ham . Ha , ha : Are you honest ? Ophe . My Lord Ham . Are you faire ? Ophe . What meanes your Lordship ? Ham . That if you be honest and faire , your Honesty should admit no discourse to your Beautie Ophe . Could Beautie my Lord , haue better Comerce then your Honestie ? Ham . I trulie : for the power of Beautie , will sooner transforme Honestie from what is , to a Bawd , then the force of Honestie can translate Beautie into his likenesse . This was sometime a Paradox , but now the time giues it proofe . I did loue you once Ophe . Indeed my Lord , you made me beleeue so Ham . You should not haue beleeued me . For vertue cannot so innocculate our old stocke , but we shall rellish of it . I loued you not Ophe . I was the more deceiued Ham . Get thee to a Nunnerie . Why would ' st thou be a breeder of Sinners ? I am my selfe indifferent honest , but yet I could accuse me of such things , that it were better my Mother had not borne me . I am very prowd , reuengefull , Ambitious , with more offences at my becke , then I haue thoughts to put them in imagination , to giue them shape , or time to acte them in . What should such Fellowes as I do , crawling betweene Heauen and Earth . We are arrant Knaues all , beleeue none of vs . Goe thy wayes to a Nunnery . Where ' s your Father ? Ophe . At home , my Lord Ham . Let the doores be shut vpon him , that he may play the Foole no way , but in ' s owne house . Farewell Ophe . O helpe him , you sweet Heauens Ham . If thou doest Marry , Ile giue thee this Plague for thy Dowrie . Be thou as chast as Ice , as pure as Snow , thou shalt not escape Calumny . Get thee to a Nunnery . Go , Farewell . Or if thou wilt needs Marry , marry a fool : for Wise men know well enough , what monsters you make of them . To a Nunnery go , and quickly too . Farwell Ophe . O heauenly Powers , restore him Ham . I haue heard of your pratlings too wel enough . God has giuen you one pace , and you make your selfe another : you gidge , you amble , and you lispe , and nickname Gods creatures , and make your Wantonnesse , your Ignorance . Go too , Ile no more on ' t , it hath made me mad . I say , we will haue no more Marriages . Those that are married already , all but one shall liue , the rest shall keep as they are . To a Nunnery , go . Exit Hamlet . Ophe . O what a Noble minde is heere o ' re - throwne ? The Courtiers , Soldiers , Schollers : Eye , tongue , sword , Th ' expectansie and Rose of the faire State , The glasse of Fashion , and the mould of Forme , Th ' obseru ' d of all Obseruers , quite , quite downe . Haue I of Ladies most deiect and wretched , That suck ' d the Honie of his Musicke Vowes : Now see that Noble , and most Soueraigne Reason , Like sweet Bels iangled out of tune , and harsh , That vnmatch ' d Forme and Feature of blowne youth , Blasted with extasie . Oh woe is me , T ' haue seene what I haue seene : see what I see . Enter King , and Polonius . King . Loue ? His affections do not that way tend , Nor what he spake , though it lack ' d Forme a little , Was not like Madnesse . There ' s something in his soule ? O ' re which his Melancholly sits on brood , And I do doubt the hatch , and the disclose Will be some danger , which to preuent I haue in quicke determination Thus set it downe . He shall with speed to England For the demand of our neglected Tribute : Haply the Seas and Countries different With variable Obiects , shall expell This something setled matter in his heart : Whereon his Braines still beating , puts him thus From fashion of himselfe . What thinke you on ' t ? Pol . It shall do well . But yet do I beleeue The Origin and Commencement of this greefe Sprung from neglected loue . How now Ophelia ? You neede not tell vs , what Lord Hamlet saide , We heard it all . My Lord , do as you please , But if you hold it fit after the Play , Let his Queene Mother all alone intreat him To shew his Greefes : let her be round with him , And Ile be plac ' d so , please you in the eare Of all their Conference . If she finde him not , To England send him : Or confine him where Your wisedome best shall thinke King . It shall be so : Madnesse in great Ones , must not vnwatch ' d go . Exeunt . Enter Hamlet , and two or three of the Players . Ham . Speake the Speech I pray you , as I pronounc ' d it to you trippingly on the Tongue : But if you mouth it , as many of your Players do , I had as liue the Town - Cryer had spoke my Lines : Nor do not saw the Ayre too much your hand thus , but vse all gently ; for in the verie Torrent , Tempest , and ( as I say ) the Whirle - winde of Passion , you must acquire and beget a Temperance that may giue it Smoothnesse . O it offends mee to the Soule , to see a robustious Pery - wig - pated Fellow , teare a Passion to tatters , to verie ragges , to split the eares of the Groundlings : who ( for the most part ) are capeable of nothing , but inexplicable dumbe shewes , & noise : I could haue such a Fellow whipt for o ' re - doing Termagant : it outHerod ' s Herod . Pray you auoid it Player . I warrant your Honor Ham . Be not too tame neyther : but let your owne Discretion be your Tutor . Sute the Action to the Word , the Word to the Action , with this speciall obseruance : That you ore - stop not the modestie of Nature ; for any thing so ouer - done , is fro [ m ] the purpose of Playing , whose end both at the first and now , was and is , to hold as ' twer the Mirrour vp to Nature ; to shew Vertue her owne Feature , Scorne her owne Image , and the verie Age and Bodie of the Time , his forme and pressure . Now , this ouer - done , or come tardie off , though it make the vnskilfull laugh , cannot but make the Iudicious greeue ; The censure of the which One , must in your allowance o ' reway a whole Theater of Others . Oh , there bee Players that I haue seene Play , and heard others praise , and that highly ( not to speake it prophanely ) that neyther hauing the accent of Christians , nor the gate of Christian , Pagan , or Norman , haue so strutted and bellowed , that I haue thought some of Natures Iouerney - men had made men , and not made them well , they imitated Humanity so abhominably Play . I hope we haue reform ' d that indifferently with vs , Sir Ham . O reforme it altogether . And let those that play your Clownes , speake no more then is set downe for them . For there be of them , that will themselues laugh , to set on some quantitie of barren Spectators to laugh too , though in the meane time , some necessary Question of the Play be then to be considered : that ' s Villanous , & shewes a most pittifull Ambition in the Foole that vses it . Go make you readie . Exit Players . Enter Polonius , Rosincrance , and Guildensterne . How now my Lord , Will the King heare this peece of Worke ? Pol . And the Queene too , and that presently Ham . Bid the Players make hast . Exit Polonius . Will you two helpe to hasten them ? Both . We will my Lord . Exeunt . Enter Horatio . Ham . What hoa , Horatio ? Hora . Heere sweet Lord , at your Seruice Ham . Horatio , thou art eene as iust a man As ere my Conuersation coap ' d withall Hora . O my deere Lord Ham . Nay , do not thinke I flatter : For what aduancement may I hope from thee , That no Reuennew hast , but thy good spirits To feed & cloath thee . Why shold the poor be flatter ' d ? No , let the Candied tongue , like absurd pompe , And crooke the pregnant Hindges of the knee , Where thrift may follow faining ? Dost thou heare , Since my deere Soule was Mistris of my choyse , And could of men distinguish , her election Hath seal ' d thee for her selfe . For thou hast bene As one in suffering all , that suffers nothing . A man that Fortunes buffets , and Rewards Hath ' tane with equall Thankes . And blest are those , Whose Blood and Iudgement are so well co - mingled , That they are not a Pipe for Fortunes finger . To sound what stop she please . Giue me that man , That is not Passions Slaue , and I will weare him In my hearts Core . I , in my Heart of heart , As I do thee . Something too much of this . There is a Play to night to before the King . One Scoene of it comes neere the Circumstance Which I haue told thee , of my Fathers death . I prythee , when thou see ' st that Acte a - foot , Euen with the verie Comment of my Soule Obserue mine Vnkle : If his occulted guilt , Do not it selfe vnkennell in one speech , It is a damned Ghost that we haue seene : And my Imaginations are as foule As Vulcans Stythe . Giue him needfull note , For I mine eyes will riuet to his Face : And after we will both our iudgements ioyne , To censure of his seeming Hora . Well my Lord . If he steale ought the whil ' st this Play is Playing , And scape detecting , I will pay the Theft . Enter King , Queene , Polonius , Ophelia , Rosincrance , Guildensterne , and other Lords attendant with his Guard carrying Torches . Danish March . Sound a Flourish . Ham . They are comming to the Play : I must be idle . Get you a place King . How fares our Cosin Hamlet ? Ham . Excellent Ifaith , of the Camelions dish : I eate the Ayre promise - cramm ' d , you cannot feed Capons so King . I haue nothing with this answer Hamlet , these words are not mine Ham . No , nor mine . Now my Lord , you plaid once i ' th ' Vniuersity , you say ? Polon . That I did my Lord , and was accounted a good Actor Ham . And what did you enact ? Pol . I did enact Iulius Caesar , I was kill ' d i ' th ' Capitol : Brutus kill ' d me Ham . It was a bruite part of him , to kill so Capitall a Calfe there . Be the Players ready ? Rosin . I my Lord , they stay vpon your patience Qu . Come hither my good Hamlet , sit by me Ha . No good Mother , here ' s Mettle more attractiue Pol . Oh ho , do you marke that ? Ham . Ladie , shall I lye in your Lap ? Ophe . No my Lord Ham . I meane , my Head vpon your Lap ? Ophe . I my Lord Ham . Do you thinke I meant Country matters ? Ophe . I thinke nothing , my Lord Ham . That ' s a faire thought to ly betweene Maids legs Ophe . What is my Lord ? Ham . Nothing Ophe . You are merrie , my Lord ? Ham . Who I ? Ophe . I my Lord Ham . Oh God , your onely Iigge - maker : what should a man do , but be merrie . For looke you how cheerefully my Mother lookes , and my Father dyed within ' s two Houres Ophe . Nay , ' tis twice two moneths , my Lord Ham . So long ? Nay then let the Diuel weare blacke , for Ile haue a suite of Sables . Oh Heauens ! dye two moneths ago , and not forgotten yet ? Then there ' s hope , a great mans Memorie , may out - liue his life halfe a yeare : But byrlady he must builde Churches then : or else shall he suffer not thinking on , with the Hoby - horsse , whose Epitaph is , For o , For o , the Hoby - horse is forgot . Hoboyes play . The dumbe shew enters . Enter a King and Queene , very louingly ; the Queene embracing him . She kneeles , and makes shew of Protestation vnto him . He takes her vp , and declines his head vpon her neck . Layes him downe vpon a Banke of Flowers . She seeing him a - sleepe , leaues him . Anon comes in a Fellow , takes off his Crowne , kisses it , and powres poyson in the Kings eares , and Exits . The Queene returnes , findes the King dead , and makes passionate Action . The Poysoner , with some two or three Mutes comes in againe , seeming to lament with her . The dead body is carried away : The Poysoner Wooes the Queene with Gifts , she seemes loath and vnwilling awhile , but in the end , accepts his loue . Exeunt . Ophe . What meanes this , my Lord ? Ham . Marry this is Miching Malicho , that meanes Mischeefe Ophe . Belike this shew imports the Argument of the Play ? Ham . We shall know by these Fellowes : the Players cannot keepe counsell , they ' l tell all Ophe . Will they tell vs what this shew meant ? Ham . I , or any shew that you ' l shew him . Bee not you asham ' d to shew , hee ' l not shame to tell you what it meanes Ophe . You are naught , you are naught , Ile marke the Play . Enter Prologue . For vs , and for our Tragedie , Heere stooping to your Clemencie : We begge your hearing Patientlie Ham . Is this a Prologue , or the Poesie of a Ring ? Ophe . ' Tis briefe my Lord Ham . As Womans loue . Enter King and his Queene . King . Full thirtie times hath Phoebus Cart gon round , Neptunes salt Wash , and Tellus Orbed ground : And thirtie dozen Moones with borrowed sheene , About the World haue times twelue thirties beene , Since loue our hearts , and Hymen did our hands Vnite comutuall , in most sacred Bands Bap . So many iournies may the Sunne and Moone Make vs againe count o ' re , ere loue be done . But woe is me , you are so sicke of late , So farre from cheere , and from your former state , That I distrust you : yet though I distrust , Discomfort you ( my Lord ) it nothing must : For womens Feare and Loue , holds quantitie , In neither ought , or in extremity : Now what my loue is , proofe hath made you know , And as my Loue is siz ' d , my Feare is so King . Faith I must leaue thee Loue , and shortly too : My operant Powers my Functions leaue to do : And thou shalt liue in this faire world behinde , Honour ' d , belou ' d , and haply , one as kinde . For Husband shalt thou - Bap . Oh confound the rest : Such Loue , must needs be Treason in my brest : In second Husband , let me be accurst , None wed the second , but who kill ' d the first Ham . Wormwood , Wormwood Bapt . The instances that second Marriage moue , Are base respects of Thrift , but none of Loue . A second time , I kill my Husband dead , When second Husband kisses me in Bed King . I do beleeue you . Think what now you speak : But what we do determine , oft we breake : Purpose is but the slaue to Memorie , Of violent Birth , but poore validitie : Which now like Fruite vnripe stickes on the Tree , But fall vnshaken , when they mellow bee . Most necessary ' tis , that we forget To pay our selues , what to our selues is debt : What to our selues in passion we propose , The passion ending , doth the purpose lose . The violence of other Greefe or Ioy , Their owne ennactors with themselues destroy : Where Ioy most Reuels , Greefe doth most lament ; Greefe ioyes , Ioy greeues on slender accident . This world is not for aye , nor ' tis not strange That euen our Loues should with our Fortunes change . For ' tis a question left vs yet to proue , Whether Loue lead Fortune , or else Fortune Loue . The great man downe , you marke his fauourites flies , The poore aduanc ' d , makes Friends of Enemies : And hitherto doth Loue on Fortune tend , For who not needs , shall neuer lacke a Frend : And who in want a hollow Friend doth try , Directly seasons him his Enemie . But orderly to end , where I begun , Our Willes and Fates do so contrary run , That our Deuices still are ouerthrowne , Our thoughts are ours , their ends none of our owne . So thinke thou wilt no second Husband wed . But die thy thoughts , when thy first Lord is dead Bap . Nor Earth to giue me food , nor Heauen light , Sport and repose locke from me day and night : Each opposite that blankes the face of ioy , Meet what I would haue well , and it destroy : Both heere , and hence , pursue me lasting strife , If once a Widdow , euer I be Wife Ham . If she should breake it now King . ' Tis deepely sworne : Sweet , leaue me heere a while , My spirits grow dull , and faine I would beguile The tedious day with sleepe Qu . Sleepe rocke thy Braine , Sleepes And neuer come mischance betweene vs twaine . Exit Ham . Madam , how like you this Play ? Qu . The Lady protests to much me thinkes Ham . Oh but shee ' l keepe her word King . Haue you heard the Argument , is there no Offence in ' t ? Ham . No , no , they do but iest , poyson in iest , no Offence i ' th ' world King . What do you call the Play ? Ham . The Mouse - trap : Marry how ? Tropically : This Play is the Image of a murder done in Vienna : Gonzago is the Dukes name , his wife Baptista : you shall see anon : ' tis a knauish peece of worke : But what o ' that ? Your Maiestie , and wee that haue free soules , it touches vs not : let the gall ' d iade winch : our withers are vnrung . Enter Lucianus . This is one Lucianus nephew to the King Ophe . You are a good Chorus , my Lord Ham . I could interpret betweene you and your loue : if I could see the Puppets dallying Ophe . You are keene my Lord , you are keene Ham . It would cost you a groaning , to take off my edge Ophe . Still better and worse Ham . So you mistake Husbands . Begin Murderer . Pox , leaue thy damnable Faces , and begin . Come , the croaking Rauen doth bellow for Reuenge Lucian . Thoughts blacke , hands apt , Drugges fit , and Time agreeing : Confederate season , else , no Creature seeing : Thou mixture ranke , of Midnight Weeds collected , With Hecats Ban , thrice blasted , thrice infected , Thy naturall Magicke , and dire propertie , On wholsome life , vsurpe immediately . Powres the poyson in his eares . Ham . He poysons him i ' th ' Garden for ' s estate : His name ' s Gonzago : the Story is extant and writ in choyce Italian . You shall see anon how the Murtherer gets the loue of Gonzago ' s wife Ophe . The King rises Ham . What , frighted with false fire Qu . How fares my Lord ? Pol . Giue o ' re the Play King . Giue me some Light . Away All . Lights , Lights , Lights . Exeunt . Manet Hamlet & Horatio . Ham . Why let the strucken Deere go weepe , The Hart vngalled play : For some must watch , while some must sleepe ; So runnes the world away . Would not this Sir , and a Forrest of Feathers , if the rest of my Fortunes turne Turke with me ; with two Prouinciall Roses on my rac ' d Shooes , get me a Fellowship in a crie of Players sir Hor . Halfe a share Ham . A whole one I , For thou dost know : Oh Damon deere , This Realme dismantled was of Ioue himselfe , And now reignes heere . A verie verie Paiocke Hora . You might haue Rim ' d Ham . Oh good Horatio , Ile take the Ghosts word for a thousand pound . Did ' st perceiue ? Hora . Verie well my Lord Ham . Vpon the talke of the poysoning ? Hora . I did verie well note him . Enter Rosincrance and Guildensterne . Ham . Oh , ha ? Come some Musick . Come y Recorders : For if the King like not the Comedie , Why then belike he likes it not perdie . Come some Musicke Guild . Good my Lord , vouchsafe me a word with you Ham . Sir , a whole History Guild . The King , sir Ham . I sir , what of him ? Guild . Is in his retyrement , maruellous distemper ' d Ham . With drinke Sir ? Guild . No my Lord , rather with choller Ham . Your wisedome should shew it selfe more richer , to signifie this to his Doctor : for for me to put him to his Purgation , would perhaps plundge him into farre more Choller Guild . Good my Lord put your discourse into some frame , and start not so wildely from my affayre Ham . I am tame Sir , pronounce Guild . The Queene your Mother , in most great affliction of spirit , hath sent me to you Ham . You are welcome Guild . Nay , good my Lord , this courtesie is not of the right breed . If it shall please you to make me a wholsome answer , I will doe your Mothers command ' ment : if not , your pardon , and my returne shall bee the end of my Businesse Ham . Sir , I cannot Guild . What , my Lord ? Ham . Make you a wholsome answere : my wits diseas ' d . But sir , such answers as I can make , you shal command : or rather you say , my Mother : therfore no more but to the matter . My Mother you say Rosin . Then thus she sayes : your behauior hath stroke her into amazement , and admiration Ham . Oh wonderfull Sonne , that can so astonish a Mother . But is there no sequell at the heeles of this Mothers admiration ? Rosin . She desires to speake with you in her Closset , ere you go to bed Ham . We shall obey , were she ten times our Mother . Haue you any further Trade with vs ? Rosin . My Lord , you once did loue me Ham . So I do still , by these pickers and stealers Rosin . Good my Lord , what is your cause of distemper ? You do freely barre the doore of your owne Libertie , if you deny your greefes to your Friend Ham . Sir I lacke Aduancement Rosin . How can that be , when you haue the voyce of the King himselfe , for your Succession in Denmarke ? Ham . I , but while the grasse growes , the Prouerbe is something musty . Enter one with a Recorder . O the Recorder . Let me see , to withdraw with you , why do you go about to recouer the winde of mee , as if you would driue me into a toyle ? Guild . O my Lord , if my Dutie be too bold , my loue is too vnmannerly Ham . I do not well vnderstand that . Will you play vpon this Pipe ? Guild . My Lord , I cannot Ham . I pray you Guild . Beleeue me , I cannot Ham . I do beseech you Guild . I know no touch of it , my Lord Ham . ' Tis as easie as lying : gouerne these Ventiges with your finger and thumbe , giue it breath with your mouth , and it will discourse most excellent Musicke . Looke you , these are the stoppes Guild . But these cannot I command to any vtterance of hermony , I haue not the skill Ham . Why looke you now , how vnworthy a thing you make of me : you would play vpon mee ; you would seeme to know my stops : you would pluck out the heart of my Mysterie ; you would sound mee from my lowest Note , to the top of my Compasse : and there is much Musicke , excellent Voice , in this little Organe , yet cannot you make it . Why do you thinke , that I am easier to bee plaid on , then a Pipe ? Call me what Instrument you will , though you can fret me , you cannot play vpon me . God blesse you Sir . Enter Polonius . Polon . My Lord ; the Queene would speak with you , and presently Ham . Do you see that Clowd ? that ' s almost in shape like a Camell Polon . By ' th ' Masse , and it ' s like a Camell indeed Ham . Me thinkes it is like a Weazell Polon . It is back ' d like a Weazell Ham . Or like a Whale ? Polon . Verie like a Whale Ham . Then will I come to my Mother , by and by : They foole me to the top of my bent . I will come by and by Polon . I will say so . Enter . Ham . By and by , is easily said . Leaue me Friends : ' Tis now the verie witching time of night , When Churchyards yawne , and Hell it selfe breaths out Contagion to this world . Now could I drink hot blood , And do such bitter businesse as the day Would quake to looke on . Soft now , to my Mother : Oh Heart , loose not thy Nature ; let not euer The Soule of Nero , enter this firme bosome : Let me be cruell , not vnnaturall , I will speake Daggers to her , but vse none : My Tongue and Soule in this be Hypocrites . How in my words someuer she be shent , To giue them Seales , neuer my Soule consent . Enter King , Rosincrance , and Guildensterne . King . I like him not , nor stands it safe with vs , To let his madnesse range . Therefore prepare you , I your Commission will forthwith dispatch , And he to England shall along with you : The termes of our estate , may not endure Hazard so dangerous as doth hourely grow Out of his Lunacies Guild . We will our selues prouide : Most holie and Religious feare it is To keepe those many many bodies safe That liue and feede vpon your Maiestie Rosin . The single And peculiar life is bound With all the strength and Armour of the minde , To keepe it selfe from noyance : but much more , That Spirit , vpon whose spirit depends and rests The liues of many , the cease of Maiestie Dies not alone ; but like a Gulfe doth draw What ' s neere it , with it . It is a massie wheele Fixt on the Somnet of the highest Mount . To whose huge Spoakes , ten thousand lesser things Are mortiz ' d and adioyn ' d : which when it falles , Each small annexment , pettie consequence Attends the boystrous Ruine . Neuer alone Did the King sighe , but with a generall grone King . Arme you , I pray you to this speedie Voyage ; For we will Fetters put vpon this feare , Which now goes too free - footed Both . We will haste vs . Exeunt . Gent . Enter Polonius . Pol . My Lord , he ' s going to his Mothers Closset : Behinde the Arras Ile conuey my selfe To heare the Processe . Ile warrant shee ' l tax him home , And as you said , and wisely was it said , ' Tis meete that some more audience then a Mother , Since Nature makes them partiall , should o ' re - heare The speech of vantage . Fare you well my Liege , Ile call vpon you ere you go to bed , And tell you what I know King . Thankes deere my Lord . Oh my offence is ranke , it smels to heauen , It hath the primall eldest curse vpon ' t , A Brothers murther . Pray can I not , Though inclination be as sharpe as will : My stronger guilt , defeats my strong intent , And like a man to double businesse bound , I stand in pause where I shall first begin , And both neglect ; what if this cursed hand Were thicker then it selfe with Brothers blood , Is there not Raine enough in the sweet Heauens To wash it white as Snow ? Whereto serues mercy , But to confront the visage of Offence ? And what ' s in Prayer , but this two - fold force , To be fore - stalled ere we come to fall , Or pardon ' d being downe ? Then Ile looke vp , My fault is past . But oh , what forme of Prayer Can serue my turne ? Forgiue me my foule Murther : That cannot be , since I am still possest Of those effects for which I did the Murther . My Crowne , mine owne Ambition , and my Queene : May one be pardon ' d , and retaine th ' offence ? In the corrupted currants of this world , Offences gilded hand may shoue by Iustice , And oft ' tis seene , the wicked prize it selfe Buyes out the Law ; but ' tis not so aboue , There is no shuffling , there the Action lyes In his true Nature , and we our selues compell ' d Euen to the teeth and forehead of our faults , To giue in euidence . What then ? What rests ? Try what Repentance can . What can it not ? Yet what can it , when one cannot repent ? Oh wretched state ! Oh bosome , blacke as death ! Oh limed soule , that strugling to be free , Art more ingag ' d : Helpe Angels , make assay : Bow stubborne knees , and heart with strings of Steele , Be soft as sinewes of the new - borne Babe , All may be well . Enter Hamlet . Ham . Now might I do it pat , now he is praying , And now Ile doo ' t , and so he goes to Heauen , And so am I reueng ' d : that would be scann ' d , A Villaine killes my Father , and for that I his foule Sonne , do this same Villaine send To heauen . Oh this is hyre and Sallery , not Reuenge . He tooke my Father grossely , full of bread , With all his Crimes broad blowne , as fresh as May , And how his Audit stands , who knowes , saue Heauen : But in our circumstance and course of thought ' Tis heauie with him : and am I then reueng ' d , To take him in the purging of his Soule , When he is fit and season ' d for his passage ? No . Vp Sword , and know thou a more horrid hent When he is drunke asleepe : or in his Rage , Or in th ' incestuous pleasure of his bed , At gaming , swearing , or about some acte That ha ' s no rellish of Saluation in ' t , Then trip him , that his heeles may kicke at Heauen , And that his Soule may be as damn ' d and blacke As Hell , whereto it goes . My Mother stayes , This Physicke but prolongs thy sickly dayes . Enter . King . My words flye vp , my thoughts remain below , Words without thoughts , neuer to Heauen go . Enter . Enter Queene and Polonius . Pol . He will come straight : Looke you lay home to him , Tell him his prankes haue been too broad to beare with , And that your Grace hath screen ' d , and stoode betweene Much heate , and him . Ile silence me e ' ene heere : Pray you be round with him Ham . within . Mother , mother , mother Qu . Ile warrant you , feare me not . Withdraw , I heare him coming . Enter Hamlet . Ham . Now Mother , what ' s the matter ? Qu . Hamlet , thou hast thy Father much offended Ham . Mother , you haue my Father much offended Qu . Come , come , you answer with an idle tongue Ham . Go , go , you question with an idle tongue Qu . Why how now Hamlet ? Ham . Whats the matter now ? Qu . Haue you forgot me ? Ham . No by the Rood , not so : You are the Queene , your Husbands Brothers wife , But would you were not so . You are my Mother Qu . Nay , then Ile set those to you that can speake Ham . Come , come , and sit you downe , you shall not boudge : You go not till I set you vp a glasse , Where you may see the inmost part of you ? Qu . What wilt thou do ? thou wilt not murther me ? Helpe , helpe , hoa Pol . What hoa , helpe , helpe , helpe Ham . How now , a Rat ? dead for a Ducate , dead Pol . Oh I am slaine . Killes Polonius Qu . Oh me , what hast thou done ? Ham . Nay I know not , is it the King ? Qu . Oh what a rash , and bloody deed is this ? Ham . A bloody deed , almost as bad good Mother , As kill a King , and marrie with his Brother Qu . As kill a King ? Ham . I Lady , ' twas my word . Thou wretched , rash , intruding foole farewell , I tooke thee for thy Betters , take thy Fortune , Thou find ' st to be too busie , is some danger . Leaue wringing of your hands , peace , sit you downe , And let me wring your heart , for so I shall If it be made of penetrable stuffe ; If damned Custome haue not braz ' d it so , That it is proofe and bulwarke against Sense Qu . What haue I done , that thou dar ' st wag thy tong , In noise so rude against me ? Ham . Such an Act That blurres the grace and blush of Modestie , Cals Vertue Hypocrite , takes off the Rose From the faire forehead of an innocent loue , And makes a blister there . Makes marriage vowes As false as Dicers Oathes . Oh such a deed , As from the body of Contraction pluckes The very soule , and sweete Religion makes A rapsidie of words . Heauens face doth glow , Yea this solidity and compound masse , With tristfull visage as against the doome , Is thought - sicke at the act Qu . Aye me ; what act , that roares so lowd , & thunders in the Index Ham . Looke heere vpon this Picture , and on this , The counterfet presentment of two Brothers : See what a grace was seated on his Brow , Hyperions curles , the front of Ioue himselfe , An eye like Mars , to threaten or command A Station , like the Herald Mercurie New lighted on a heauen - kissing hill : A Combination , and a forme indeed , Where euery God did seeme to set his Seale , To giue the world assurance of a man . This was your Husband . Looke you now what followes . Heere is your Husband , like a Mildew ' d eare Blasting his wholsom breath . Haue you eyes ? Could you on this faire Mountaine leaue to feed , And batten on this Moore ? Ha ? Haue you eyes ? You cannot call it Loue : For at your age , The hey - day in the blood is tame , it ' s humble , And waites vpon the Iudgement : and what Iudgement Would step from this , to this ? What diuell was ' t , That thus hath cousend you at hoodman - blinde ? O Shame ! where is thy Blush ? Rebellious Hell , If thou canst mutine in a Matrons bones , To flaming youth , let Vertue be as waxe . And melt in her owne fire . Proclaime no shame , When the compulsiue Ardure giues the charge , Since Frost it selfe , as actiuely doth burne , As Reason panders Will Qu . O Hamlet , speake no more . Thou turn ' st mine eyes into my very soule , And there I see such blacke and grained spots , As will not leaue their Tinct Ham . Nay , but to liue In the ranke sweat of an enseamed bed , Stew ' d in Corruption ; honying and making loue Ouer the nasty Stye Qu . Oh speake to me , no more , These words like Daggers enter in mine eares . No more sweet Hamlet Ham . A Murderer , and a Villaine : A Slaue , that is not twentieth part the tythe Of your precedent Lord . A vice of Kings , A Cutpurse of the Empire and the Rule . That from a shelfe , the precious Diadem stole , And put it in his Pocket Qu . No more . Enter Ghost . Ham . A King of shreds and patches . Saue me ; and houer o ' re me with your wings You heauenly Guards . What would your gracious figure ? Qu . Alas he ' s mad Ham . Do you not come your tardy Sonne to chide , That laps ' t in Time and Passion , lets go by Th ' important acting of your dread command ? Oh say Ghost . Do not forget : this Visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose . But looke , Amazement on thy Mother sits ; O step betweene her , and her fighting Soule , Conceit in weakest bodies , strongest workes . Speake to her Hamlet Ham . How is it with you Lady ? Qu . Alas , how is ' t with you ? That you bend your eye on vacancie , And with their corporall ayre do hold discourse . Forth at your eyes , your spirits wildely peepe , And as the sleeping Soldiours in th ' Alarme , Your bedded haire , like life in excrements , Start vp , and stand an end . Oh gentle Sonne , Vpon the heate and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle coole patience . Whereon do you looke ? Ham . On him , on him : look you how pale he glares , His forme and cause conioyn ' d , preaching to stones , Would make them capeable . Do not looke vpon me , Least with this pitteous action you conuert My sterne effects : then what I haue to do , Will want true colour ; teares perchance for blood Qu . To who do you speake this ? Ham . Do you see nothing there ? Qu . Nothing at all , yet all that is I see Ham . Nor did you nothing heare ? Qu . No , nothing but our selues Ham . Why look you there : looke how it steals away : My Father in his habite , as he liued , Looke where he goes euen now out at the Portall . Enter . Qu . This is the very coynage of your Braine , This bodilesse Creation extasie is very cunning in Ham . Extasie ? My Pulse as yours doth temperately keepe time , And makes as healthfull Musicke . It is not madnesse That I haue vttered ; bring me to the Test And I the matter will re - word : which madnesse Would gamboll from . Mother , for loue of Grace , Lay not a flattering Vnction to your soule , That not your trespasse , but my madnesse speakes : It will but skin and filme the Vlcerous place , Whil ' st ranke Corruption mining all within , Infects vnseene . Confesse your selfe to Heauen , Repent what ' s past , auoyd what is to come , And do not spred the Compost on the Weedes , To make them ranke . Forgiue me this my Vertue , For in the fatnesse of this pursie times , Vertue it selfe , of Vice must pardon begge , Yea courb , and woe , for leaue to do him good Qu . Oh Hamlet , Thou hast cleft my heart in twaine Ham . O throw away the worser part of it , And liue the purer with the other halfe . Good night , but go not to mine Vnkles bed , Assume a Vertue , if you haue it not , refraine to night , And that shall lend a kinde of easinesse To the next abstinence . Once more goodnight , And when you are desirous to be blest , Ile blessing begge of you . For this same Lord , I do repent : but heauen hath pleas ' d it so , To punish me with this , and this with me , That I must be their Scourge and Minister . I will bestow him , and will answer well The death I gaue him : so againe , good night . I must be cruell , onely to be kinde ; Thus bad begins and worse remaines behinde Qu . What shall I do ? Ham . Not this by no meanes that I bid you do : Let the blunt King tempt you againe to bed , Pinch Wanton on your cheeke , call you his Mouse , And let him for a paire of reechie kisses , Or padling in your necke with his damn ' d Fingers , Make you to rauell all this matter out , That I essentially am not in madnesse , But made in craft . ' Twere good you let him know , For who that ' s but a Queene , faire , sober , wise , Would from a Paddocke , from a Bat , a Gibbe , Such deere concernings hide , Who would do so , No in despight of Sense and Secrecie , Vnpegge the Basket on the houses top : Let the Birds flye , and like the famous Ape To try Conclusions in the Basket , creepe And breake your owne necke downe Qu . Be thou assur ' d , if words be made of breath , And breath of life : I haue no life to breath What thou hast saide to me Ham . I must to England , you know that ? Qu . Alacke I had forgot : ' Tis so concluded on Ham . This man shall set me packing : Ile lugge the Guts into the Neighbor roome , Mother goodnight . Indeede this Counsellor Is now most still , most secret , and most graue , Who was in life , a foolish prating Knaue . Come sir , to draw toward an end with you . Good night Mother . Exit Hamlet tugging in Polonius . Enter King . King . There ' s matters in these sighes . These profound heaues You must translate ; Tis fit we vnderstand them . Where is your Sonne ? Qu . Ah my good Lord , what haue I seene to night ? King . What Gertrude ? How do ' s Hamlet ? Qu . Mad as the Seas , and winde , when both contend Which is the Mightier , in his lawlesse fit Behinde the Arras , hearing something stirre , He whips his Rapier out , and cries a Rat , a Rat , And in his brainish apprehension killes The vnseene good old man King . Oh heauy deed : It had bin so with vs had we beene there : His Liberty is full of threats to all , To you your selfe , to vs , to euery one . Alas , how shall this bloody deede be answered ? It will be laide to vs , whose prouidence Should haue kept short , restrain ' d , and out of haunt , This mad yong man . But so much was our loue , We would not vnderstand what was most fit , But like the Owner of a foule disease , To keepe it from divulging , let ' s it feede Euen on the pith of life . Where is he gone ? Qu . To draw apart the body he hath kild , O ' re whom his very madnesse like some Oare Among a Minerall of Mettels base Shewes it selfe pure . He weepes for what is done King . Oh Gertrude , come away : The Sun no sooner shall the Mountaines touch , But we will ship him hence , and this vilde deed , We must with all our Maiesty and Skill Both countenance , and excuse . Enter Ros . & Guild . Ho Guildenstern : Friends both go ioyne you with some further ayde : Hamlet in madnesse hath Polonius slaine , And from his Mother Clossets hath he drag ' d him . Go seeke him out , speake faire , and bring the body Into the Chappell . I pray you hast in this . Exit Gent . Come Gertrude , wee ' l call vp our wisest friends , To let them know both what we meane to do , And what ' s vntimely done . Oh come away , My soule is full of discord and dismay . Exeunt .

Besides , to be demanded of a Spundge , what replication should be made by the Sonne of a King Rosin . Take you me for a Spundge , my Lord ? Ham . I sir , that sokes vp the Kings Countenance , his Rewards , his Authorities ( but such Officers do the King best seruice in the end . He keepes them like an Ape in the corner of his iaw , first mouth ' d to be last swallowed , when he needes what you haue glean ' d , it is but squeezing you , and Spundge you shall be dry againe Rosin . I vnderstand you not my Lord Ham . I am glad of it : a knauish speech sleepes in a foolish eare Rosin . My Lord , you must tell vs where the body is , and go with vs to the King Ham . The body is with the King , but the King is not with the body . The King , is a thing - Guild . A thing my Lord ? Ham . Of nothing : bring me to him , hide Fox , and all after . Exeunt . Enter King . King . I haue sent to seeke him , and to find the bodie : How dangerous is it that this man goes loose : Yet must not we put the strong Law on him : Hee ' s loued of the distracted multitude , Who like not in their iudgement , but their eyes : And where ' tis so , th ' Offenders scourge is weigh ' d But neerer the offence : to beare all smooth , and euen , This sodaine sending him away , must seeme Deliberate pause , diseases desperate growne , By desperate appliance are releeued , Or not at all .

We fat all creatures else to fat vs , and we fat our selfe for Magots . Your fat King , and your leane Begger is but variable seruice to dishes , but to one Table that ' s the end King . What dost thou meane by this ? Ham . Nothing but to shew you how a King may go a Progresse through the guts of a Begger King . Where is Polonius Ham . In heauen , send thither to see . If your Messenger finde him not there , seeke him i ' th other place your selfe : but indeed , if you finde him not this moneth , you shall nose him as you go vp the staires into the Lobby King . Go seeke him there Ham . He will stay till ye come K . Hamlet , this deed of thine , for thine especial safety Which we do tender , as we deerely greeue For that which thou hast done , must send thee hence With fierie Quicknesse .

And England , if my loue thou holdst at ought , As my great power thereof may giue thee sense , Since yet thy Cicatrice lookes raw and red After the Danish Sword , and thy free awe Payes homage to vs ; thou maist not coldly set Our Soueraigne Processe , which imports at full By Letters coniuring to that effect The present death of Hamlet . Do it England , For like the Hecticke in my blood he rages , And thou must cure me : Till I know ' tis done , How ere my happes , my ioyes were ne ' re begun . Exit Enter Fortinbras with an Armie .

Enter Queene and Horatio . Qu . I will not speake with her Hor . She is importunate , indeed distract , her moode will needs be pittied Qu . What would she haue ? Hor . She speakes much of her Father ; saies she heares There ' s trickes i ' th ' world , and hems , and beats her heart , Spurnes enuiously at Strawes , speakes things in doubt , That carry but halfe sense : Her speech is nothing , Yet the vnshaped vse of it doth moue The hearers to Collection ; they ayme at it , And botch the words vp fit to their owne thoughts , Which as her winkes , and nods , and gestures yeeld them , Indeed would make one thinke there would be thought , Though nothing sure , yet much vnhappily Qu . ' Twere good she were spoken with , For she may strew dangerous coniectures In ill breeding minds . Let her come in . To my sicke soule ( as sinnes true Nature is ) Each toy seemes Prologue , to some great amisse , So full of Artlesse iealousie is guilt , It spill ' s it selfe , in fearing to be spilt . Enter Ophelia distracted . Ophe . Where is the beauteous Maiesty of Denmark Qu . How now Ophelia ? Ophe . How should I your true loue know from another one ? By his Cockle hat and staffe , and his Sandal shoone Qu . Alas sweet Lady : what imports this Song ? Ophe . Say you ? Nay pray you marke .

Conceit vpon her Father Ophe . Pray you let ' s haue no words of this : but when they aske you what it meanes , say you this : To morrow is S [ aint ]. Valentines day , all in the morning betime , And I a Maid at your Window , to be your Valentine .

Indeed la ? without an oath Ile make an end ont . By gis , and by S [ aint ]. Charity , Alacke , and fie for shame : Yong men wil doo ' t , if they come too ' t , By Cocke they are too blame . Quoth she before you tumbled me , You promis ' d me to Wed : So would I ha done by yonder Sunne , And thou hadst not come to my bed King . How long hath she bin thus ? Ophe . I hope all will be well . We must bee patient , but I cannot choose but weepe , to thinke they should lay him i ' th ' cold ground : My brother shall knowe of it , and so I thanke you for your good counsell . Come , my Coach : Goodnight Ladies : Goodnight sweet Ladies : Goodnight , goodnight . Enter . King . Follow her close , Giue her good watch I pray you : Oh this is the poyson of deepe greefe , it springs All from her Fathers death . Oh Gertrude , Gertrude , When sorrowes comes , they come not single spies , But in Battalians . First , her Father slaine , Next your Sonne gone , and he most violent Author Of his owne iust remoue : the people muddied , Thicke and vnwholsome in their thoughts , and whispers For good Polonius death ; and we haue done but greenly In hugger mugger to interre him . Poore Ophelia Diuided from her selfe , and her faire Iudgement , Without the which we are Pictures , or meere Beasts . Last , and as much containing as all these , Her Brother is in secret come from France , Keepes on his wonder , keepes himselfe in clouds , And wants not Buzzers to infect his eare With pestilent Speeches of his Fathers death , Where in necessitie of matter Beggard , Will nothing sticke our persons to Arraigne In eare and eare . O my deere Gertrude , this , Like to a murdering Peece in many places , Giues me superfluous death . A Noise within . Enter a Messenger . Qu . Alacke , what noyse is this ? King . Where are my Switzers ? Let them guard the doore . What is the matter ? Mes . Saue your selfe , my Lord . The Ocean ( ouer - peering of his List ) Eates not the Flats with more impittious haste Then young Laertes , in a Riotous head , Ore - beares your Officers , the rabble call him Lord , And as the world were now but to begin , Antiquity forgot , Custome not knowne , The Ratifiers and props of euery word , They cry choose we ? Laertes shall be King , Caps , hands , and tongues , applaud it to the clouds , Laertes shall be King , Laertes King Qu . How cheerefully on the false Traile they cry , Oh this is Counter you false Danish Dogges . Noise within . Enter Laertes . King . The doores are broke Laer . Where is the King , sirs ?

Calmely good Laertes Laer . That drop of blood , that calmes Proclaimes me Bastard : Cries Cuckold to my Father , brands the Harlot Euen heere betweene the chaste vnsmirched brow Of my true Mother King . What is the cause Laertes , That thy Rebellion lookes so Gyant - like ? Let him go Gertrude : Do not feare our person : There ' s such Diuinity doth hedge a King , That Treason can but peepe to what it would , Acts little of his will . Tell me Laertes , Why thou art thus Incenst ? Let him go Gertrude . Speake man Laer . Where ' s my Father ? King . Dead Qu . But not by him King . Let him demand his fill Laer . How came he dead ? Ile not be Iuggel ' d with . To hell Allegeance : Vowes , to the blackest diuell . Conscience and Grace , to the profoundest Pit . I dare Damnation : to this point I stand , That both the worlds I giue to negligence , Let come what comes : onely Ile be reueng ' d Most throughly for my Father King . Who shall stay you ? Laer . My Will , not all the world , And for my meanes , Ile husband them so well , They shall go farre with little King . Good Laertes : If you desire to know the certaintie Of your deere Fathers death , if writ in your reuenge , That Soop - stake you will draw both Friend and Foe , Winner and Looser Laer . None but his Enemies King . Will you know them then La . To his good Friends , thus wide Ile ope my Armes : And like the kinde Life - rend ' ring Politician , Repast them with my blood King . Why now you speake Like a good Childe , and a true Gentleman . That I am guiltlesse of your Fathers death , And am most sensible in greefe for it , It shall as leuell to your Iudgement pierce As day do ' s to your eye . A noise within . Let her come in . Enter Ophelia . Laer . How now ? what noise is that ? Oh heate drie vp my Braines , teares seuen times salt , Burne out the Sence and Vertue of mine eye . By Heauen , thy madnesse shall be payed by waight , Till our Scale turnes the beame . Oh Rose of May , Deere Maid , kinde Sister , sweet Ophelia : Oh Heauens , is ' t possible , a yong Maids wits , Should be as mortall as an old mans life ? Nature is fine in Loue , and where ' tis fine , It sends some precious instance of it selfe After the thing it loues Ophe . They bore him bare fac ' d on the Beer , Hey non nony , nony , hey nony : And on his graue raines many a teare , Fare you well my Doue Laer . Had ' st thou thy wits , and did ' st perswade Reuenge , it could not moue thus Ophe . You must sing downe a - downe , and you call him a - downe - a . Oh , how the wheele becomes it ? It is the false Steward that stole his masters daughter Laer . This nothings more then matter Ophe . There ' s Rosemary , that ' s for Remembraunce . Pray loue remember : and there is Paconcies , that ' s for Thoughts Laer . A document in madnesse , thoughts & remembrance fitted Ophe . There ' s Fennell for you , and Columbines : ther ' s Rew for you , and heere ' s some for me . Wee may call it Herbe - Grace a Sundaies : Oh you must weare your Rew with a difference . There ' s a Daysie , I would giue you some Violets , but they wither ' d all when my Father dyed : They say , he made a good end ; For bonny sweet Robin is all my ioy Laer . Thought , and Affliction , Passion , Hell it selfe : She turnes to Fauour , and to prettinesse Ophe . And will he not come againe , And will he not come againe : No , no , he is dead , go to thy Death - bed , He neuer wil come againe . His Beard as white as Snow , All Flaxen was his Pole : He is gone , he is gone , and we cast away mone , Gramercy on his Soule . And of all Christian Soules , I pray God . God buy ye . Exeunt . Ophelia Laer . Do you see this , you Gods ? King . Laertes , I must common with your greefe , Or you deny me right : go but apart , Make choice of whom your wisest Friends you will , And they shall heare and iudge ' twixt you and me ; If by direct or by Colaterall hand They finde vs touch ' d , we will our Kingdome giue , Our Crowne , our Life , and all that we call Ours To you in satisfaction . But if not , Be you content to lend your patience to vs , And we shall ioyntly labour with your soule To giue it due content Laer . Let this be so : His meanes of death , his obscure buriall ; No Trophee , Sword , nor Hatchment o ' re his bones , No Noble rite , nor formall ostentation , Cry to be heard , as ' twere from Heauen to Earth , That I must call in question King . So you shall : And where th ' offence is , let the great Axe fall . I pray you go with me . Exeunt . Enter Horatio , with an Attendant . Hora . What are they that would speake with me ? Ser . Saylors sir , they say they haue Letters for you Hor . Let them come in , I do not know from what part of the world I should be greeted , if not from Lord Hamlet . Enter Saylor . Say . God blesse you Sir Hor . Let him blesse thee too Say . Hee shall Sir , and ' t please him . There ' s a Letter for you Sir : It comes from th ' Ambassadours that was bound for England , if your name be Horatio , as I am let to know it is . Reads the Letter . Horatio , When thou shalt haue ouerlook ' d this , giue these Fellowes some meanes to the King : They haue Letters for him . Ere we were two dayes old at Sea , a Pyrate of very Warlicke appointment gaue vs Chace . Finding our selues too slow of Saile , we put on a compelled Valour . In the Grapple , I boorded them : On the instant they got cleare of our Shippe , so I alone became their Prisoner . They haue dealt with mee , like Theeues of Mercy , but they knew what they did . I am to doe a good turne for them . Let the King haue the Letters I haue sent , and repaire thou to me with as much hast as thou wouldest flye death . I haue words to speake in your eare , will make thee dumbe , yet are they much too light for the bore of the Matter . These good Fellowes will bring thee where I am . Rosincrance and Guildensterne , hold their course for England . Of them I haue much to tell thee , Farewell . He that thou knowest thine , Hamlet . Come , I will giue you way for these your Letters , And do ' t the speedier , that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them . Enter . Enter King and Laertes . King . Now must your conscience my acquittance seal , And you must put me in your heart for Friend , Sith you haue heard , and with a knowing eare , That he which hath your Noble Father slaine , Pursued my life Laer . It well appeares . But tell me , Why you proceeded not against these feates , So crimefull , and so Capitall in Nature , As by your Safety , Wisedome , all things else , You mainly were stirr ' d vp ? King . O for two speciall Reasons , Which may to you ( perhaps ) seeme much vnsinnowed , And yet to me they are strong . The Queen his Mother , Liues almost by his lookes : and for my selfe , My Vertue or my Plague , be it either which , She ' s so coniunctiue to my life , and soule ; That as the Starre moues not but in his Sphere , I could not but by her . The other Motiue , Why to a publike count I might not go , Is the great loue the generall gender beare him , Who dipping all his Faults in their affection , Would like the Spring that turneth Wood to Stone , Conuert his Gyues to Graces . So that my Arrowes Too slightly timbred for so loud a Winde , Would haue reuerted to my Bow againe , And not where I had arm ' d them Laer . And so haue I a Noble Father lost , A Sister driuen into desperate tearmes , Who was ( if praises may go backe againe ) Stood Challenger on mount of all the Age For her perfections . But my reuenge will come King . Breake not your sleepes for that , You must not thinke That we are made of stuffe , so flat , and dull , That we can let our Beard be shooke with danger , And thinke it pastime . You shortly shall heare more , I lou ' d your Father , and we loue our Selfe , And that I hope will teach you to imagine - Enter a Messenger . How now ? What Newes ? Mes . Letters my Lord from Hamlet , This to your Maiesty : this to the Queene King . From Hamlet ? Who brought them ? Mes . Saylors my Lord they say , I saw them not : They were giuen me by Claudio , he receiu ' d them King . Laertes you shall heare them : Leaue vs . Exit Messenger High and Mighty , you shall know I am set naked on your Kingdome . To morrow shall I begge leaue to see your Kingly Eyes . When I shall ( first asking your Pardon thereunto ) recount th ' Occasions of my sodaine , and more strange returne . Hamlet . What should this meane ? Are all the rest come backe ? Or is it some abuse ? Or no such thing ? Laer . Know you the hand ? Kin . ' Tis Hamlets Character , naked and in a Postscript here he sayes alone : Can you aduise me ? Laer . I ' m lost in it my Lord ; but let him come , It warmes the very sicknesse in my heart , That I shall liue and tell him to his teeth ; Thus diddest thou Kin . If it be so Laertes , as how should it be so : How otherwise will you be rul ' d by me ? Laer . If so you ' l not o ' rerule me to a peace Kin . To thine owne peace : if he be now return ' d , As checking at his Voyage , and that he meanes No more to vndertake it ; I will worke him To an exployt now ripe in my Deuice , Vnder the which he shall not choose but fall ; And for his death no winde of blame shall breath , But euen his Mother shall vncharge the practice , And call it accident : Some two Monthes hence Here was a Gentleman of Normandy , I ' ue seene my selfe , and seru ' d against the French , And they ran well on Horsebacke ; but this Gallant Had witchcraft in ' t ; he grew into his Seat , And to such wondrous doing brought his Horse , As had he beene encorps ' t and demy - Natur ' d With the braue Beast , so farre he past my thought , That I in forgery of shapes and trickes , Come short of what he did Laer . A Norman was ' t ? Kin . A Norman Laer . Vpon my life Lamound Kin . The very same Laer . I know him well , he is the Brooch indeed , And Iemme of all our Nation Kin . Hee mad confession of you , And gaue you such a Masterly report , For Art and exercise in your defence ; And for your Rapier most especiall , That he cryed out , t ' would be a sight indeed , If one could match you Sir . This report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his Enuy , That he could nothing doe but wish and begge , Your sodaine comming ore to play with him ; Now out of this Laer . Why out of this , my Lord ? Kin . Laertes was your Father deare to you ? Or are you like the painting of a sorrow , A face without a heart ? Laer . Why aske you this ? Kin . Not that I thinke you did not loue your Father , But that I know Loue is begun by Time : And that I see in passages of proofe , Time qualifies the sparke and fire of it : Hamlet comes backe : what would you vndertake , To show your selfe your Fathers sonne indeed , More then in words ? Laer . To cut his throat i ' th ' Church Kin . No place indeed should murder Sancturize ; Reuenge should haue no bounds : but good Laertes Will you doe this , keepe close within your Chamber , Hamlet return ' d , shall know you are come home : Wee ' l put on those shall praise your excellence , And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gaue you , bring you in fine together , And wager on your heads , he being remisse , Most generous , and free from all contriuing , Will not peruse the Foiles ? So that with ease , Or with a little shuffling , you may choose A Sword vnbaited , and in a passe of practice , Requit him for your Father Laer . I will doo ' t . And for that purpose Ile annoint my Sword : I bought an Vnction of a Mountebanke So mortall , I but dipt a knife in it , Where it drawes blood , no Cataplasme so rare , Collected from all Simples that haue Vertue Vnder the Moone , can saue the thing from death , That is but scratcht withall : Ile touch my point , With this contagion , that if I gall him slightly , It may be death Kin . Let ' s further thinke of this , Weigh what conuenience both of time and meanes May fit vs to our shape , if this should faile ; And that our drift looke through our bad performance , ' Twere better not assaid ; therefore this Proiect Should haue a backe or second , that might hold , If this should blast in proofe : Soft , let me see Wee ' l make a solemne wager on your commings , I ha ' t : when in your motion you are hot and dry , As make your bowts more violent to the end , And that he cals for drinke ; Ile haue prepar ' d him A Challice for the nonce ; whereon but sipping , If he by chance escape your venom ' d stuck , Our purpose may hold there ; how sweet Queene . Enter Queene . Queen . One woe doth tread vpon anothers heele , So fast they ' l follow : your Sister ' s drown ' d Laertes Laer . Drown ' d ! O where ? Queen . There is a Willow growes aslant a Brooke , That shewes his hore leaues in the glassie streame : There with fantasticke Garlands did she come , Of Crow - flowers , Nettles , Daysies , and long Purples , That liberall Shepheards giue a grosser name ; But our cold Maids doe Dead Mens Fingers call them : There on the pendant boughes , her Coronet weeds Clambring to hang ; an enuious sliuer broke , When downe the weedy Trophies , and her selfe , Fell in the weeping Brooke , her cloathes spred wide , And Mermaid - like , a while they bore her vp , Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes , As one incapable of her owne distresse , Or like a creature Natiue , and indued Vnto that Element : but long it could not be , Till that her garments , heauy with her drinke , Pul ' d the poore wretch from her melodious buy , To muddy death Laer . Alas then , is she drown ' d ? Queen . Drown ' d , drown ' d Laer . Too much of water hast thou poore Ophelia , And therefore I forbid my teares : but yet It is our tricke , Nature her custome holds , Let shame say what it will ; when these are gone The woman will be out : Adue my Lord , I haue a speech of fire , that faine would blaze , But that this folly doubts it . Enter . Kin . Let ' s follow , Gertrude : How much I had to doe to calme his rage ? Now feare I this will giue it start againe ; Therefore let ' s follow . Exeunt . Enter two Clownes . Clown . Is she to bee buried in Christian buriall , that wilfully seekes her owne saluation ? Other . I tell thee she is , and therefore make her Graue straight , the Crowner hath sate on her , and finds it Christian buriall Clo . How can that be , vnlesse she drowned her selfe in her owne defence ? Other . Why ' tis found so Clo . It must be Se offendendo , it cannot bee else : for heere lies the point ; If I drowne my selfe wittingly , it argues an Act : and an Act hath three branches . It is an Act to doe and to performe ; argall she drown ' d her selfe wittingly Other . Nay but heare you Goodman Deluer Clown . Giue me leaue ; heere lies the water ; good : heere stands the man ; good : If the man goe to this water and drowne himselfe ; it is will he nill he , he goes ; marke you that ? But if the water come to him & drowne him ; hee drownes not himselfe . Argall , hee that is not guilty of his owne death , shortens not his owne life Other . But is this law ? Clo . I marry is ' t , Crowners Quest Law Other . Will you ha the truth on ' t : if this had not beene a Gentlewoman , shee should haue beene buried out of Christian Buriall Clo . Why there thou say ' st . And the more pitty that great folke should haue countenance in this world to drowne or hang themselues , more then their euen Christian . Come , my Spade ; there is no ancient Gentlemen , but Gardiners , Ditchers and Graue - makers ; they hold vp Adams Profession Other . Was he a Gentleman ? Clo . He was the first that euer bore Armes Other . Why he had none Clo . What , ar ' t a Heathen ? how doth thou vnderstand the Scripture ? the Scripture sayes Adam dig ' d ; could hee digge without Armes ? Ile put another question to thee ; if thou answerest me not to the purpose , confesse thy selfe - Other . Go too Clo . What is he that builds stronger then either the Mason , the Shipwright , or the Carpenter ? Other . The Gallowes maker ; for that Frame outliues a thousand Tenants Clo . I like thy wit well in good faith , the Gallowes does well ; but how does it well ? it does well to those that doe ill : now , thou dost ill to say the Gallowes is built stronger then the Church : Argall , the Gallowes may doe well to thee . Too ' t againe , Come Other . Who builds stronger then a Mason , a Shipwright , or a Carpenter ? Clo . I , tell me that , and vnyoake Other . Marry , now I can tell Clo . Too ' t Other . Masse , I cannot tell . Enter Hamlet and Horatio a farre off . Clo . Cudgell thy braines no more about it ; for your dull Asse will not mend his pace with beating ; and when you are ask ' t this question next , say a Graue - maker : the Houses that he makes , lasts till Doomesday : go , get thee to Yaughan , fetch me a stoupe of Liquor . Sings . In youth when I did loue , did loue , me thought it was very sweete : To contract O the time for a my behoue , O me thought there was nothing meete Ham . Ha ' s this fellow no feeling of his businesse , that he sings at Graue - making ? Hor . Custome hath made it in him a property of easinesse Ham . ' Tis ee ' n so ; the hand of little Imployment hath the daintier sense Clowne sings . But Age with his stealing steps hath caught me in his clutch : And hath shipped me intill the Land , as if I had neuer beene such Ham . That Scull had a tongue in it , and could sing once : how the knaue iowles it to th ' grownd , as if it were Caines Iaw - bone , that did the first murther : It might be the Pate of a Polititian which this Asse o ' re Offices : one that could circumuent God , might it not ? Hor . It might , my Lord Ham . Or of a Courtier , which could say , Good Morrow sweet Lord : how dost thou , good Lord ? this might be my Lord such a one , that prais ' d my Lord such a ones Horse , when he meant to begge it ; might it not ? Hor . I , my Lord Ham . Why ee ' n so : and now my Lady Wormes , Chaplesse , and knockt about the Mazard with a Sextons Spade ; heere ' s fine Reuolution , if wee had the tricke to see ' t . Did these bones cost no more the breeding , but to play at Loggets with ' em ? mine ake to thinke on ' t Clowne sings . A Pickhaxe and a Spade , a Spade , for and a shrowding - Sheete : O a Pit of Clay for to be made , for such a Guest is meete Ham . There ' s another : why might not that bee the Scull of a Lawyer ? where be his Quiddits now ? his Quillets ? his Cases ? his Tenures , and his Tricks ? why doe ' s he suffer this rude knaue now to knocke him about the Sconce with a dirty Shouell , and will not tell him of his Action of Battery ? hum . This fellow might be in ' s time a great buyer of Land , with his Statutes , his Recognizances , his Fines , his double Vouchers , his Recoueries : Is this the fine of his Fines , and the recouery of his Recoueries , to haue his fine Pate full of fine Dirt ? will his Vouchers vouch him no more of his Purchases , and double ones too , then the length and breadth of a paire of Indentures ? the very Conueyances of his Lands will hardly lye in this Boxe ; and must the Inheritor himselfe haue no more ? ha ? Hor . Not a iot more , my Lord Ham . Is not Parchment made of Sheep - skinnes ? Hor . I my Lord , and of Calue - skinnes too Ham . They are Sheepe and Calues that seek out assurance in that . I will speake to this fellow : whose Graue ' s this Sir ? Clo . Mine Sir : O a Pit of Clay for to be made , for such a Guest is meete Ham . I thinke it be thine indeed : for thou liest in ' t Clo . You lye out on ' t Sir , and therefore it is not yours : for my part , I doe not lye in ' t ; and yet it is mine Ham . Thou dost lye in ' t , to be in ' t and say ' tis thine : ' tis for the dead , not for the quicke , therefore thou lyest Clo . ' Tis a quicke lye Sir , ' twill away againe from me to you Ham . What man dost thou digge it for ? Clo . For no man Sir Ham . What woman then ? Clo . For none neither Ham . Who is to be buried in ' t ? Clo . One that was a woman Sir ; but rest her Soule , shee ' s dead Ham . How absolute the knaue is ? wee must speake by the Carde , or equiuocation will vndoe vs : by the Lord Horatio , these three yeares I haue taken note of it , the Age is growne so picked , that the toe of the Pesant comes so neere the heeles of our Courtier , hee galls his Kibe . How long hast thou been a Graue - maker ? Clo . Of all the dayes i ' th ' yeare , I came too ' t that day that our last King Hamlet o ' recame Fortinbras Ham . How long is that since ? Clo . Cannot you tell that ? euery foole can tell that : It was the very day , that young Hamlet was borne , hee that was mad , and sent into England Ham . I marry , why was he sent into England ? Clo . Why , because he was mad ; hee shall recouer his wits there ; or if he do not , it ' s no great matter there Ham . Why ? Clo . ' Twill not be seene in him , there the men are as mad as he Ham . How came he mad ? Clo . Very strangely they say Ham . How strangely ? Clo . Faith e ' ene with loosing his wits Ham . Vpon what ground ? Clo . Why heere in Denmarke : I haue bin sixeteene heere , man and Boy thirty yeares Ham . How long will a man lie i ' th ' earth ere he rot ? Clo . Ifaith , if he be not rotten before he die ( as we haue many pocky Coarses now adaies , that will scarce hold the laying in ) he will last you some eight yeare , or nine yeare . A Tanner will last you nine yeare Ham . Why he , more then another ? Clo . Why sir , his hide is so tan ' d with his Trade , that he will keepe out water a great while . And your water , is a sore Decayer of your horson dead body . Heres a Scull now : this Scul , has laine in the earth three & twenty years Ham . Whose was it ? Clo . A whoreson mad Fellowes it was ; Whose doe you thinke it was ? Ham . Nay , I know not Clo . A pestilence on him for a mad Rogue , a pour ' d a Flaggon of Renish on my head once . This same Scull Sir , this same Scull sir , was Yoricks Scull , the Kings Iester Ham . This ? Clo . E ' ene that Ham . Let me see . Alas poore Yorick , I knew him Horatio , a fellow of infinite Iest ; of most excellent fancy , he hath borne me on his backe a thousand times : And how abhorred my Imagination is , my gorge rises at it . Heere hung those lipps , that I haue kist I know not how oft . Where be your Iibes now ? Your Gambals ? Your Songs ? Your flashes of Merriment that were wont to set the Table on a Rore ? No one now to mock your own Ieering ? Quite chopfalne ? Now get you to my Ladies Chamber , and tell her , let her paint an inch thicke , to this fauour she must come . Make her laugh at that : prythee Horatio tell me one thing Hor . What ' s that my Lord ? Ham . Dost thou thinke Alexander lookt o ' this fashion i ' th ' earth ? Hor . E ' ene so Ham . And smelt so ? Puh Hor . E ' ene so , my Lord Ham . To what base vses we may returne Horatio . Why may not Imagination trace the Noble dust of Alexander , till he find it stopping a bunghole Hor . ' Twere to consider : to curiously to consider so Ham . No faith , not a iot . But to follow him thether with modestie enough , & likeliehood to lead it ; as thus . Alexander died : Alexander was buried : Alexander returneth into dust ; the dust is earth ; of earth we make Lome , and why of that Lome ( whereto he was conuerted ) might they not stopp a Beere - barrell ? Imperiall Caesar , dead and turn ' d to clay , Might stop a hole to keepe the winde away . Oh , that that earth , which kept the world in awe , Should patch a Wall , t ' expell the winters flaw . But soft , but soft , aside ; heere comes the King . Enter King , Queene , Laertes , and a Coffin , with Lords attendant . The Queene , the Courtiers . Who is that they follow , And with such maimed rites ? This doth betoken , The Coarse they follow , did with disperate hand , Fore do it owne life ; ' twas some Estate . Couch we a while , and mark Laer . What Cerimony else ? Ham . That is Laertes , a very Noble youth : Marke Laer . What Cerimony else ? Priest . Her Obsequies haue bin as farre inlarg ' d . As we haue warrantie , her death was doubtfull , And but that great Command , o ' re - swaies the order , She should in ground vnsanctified haue lodg ' d , Till the last Trumpet . For charitable praier , Shardes , Flints , and Peebles , should be throwne on her : Yet heere she is allowed her Virgin Rites , Her Maiden strewments , and the bringing home Of Bell and Buriall Laer . Must there no more be done ? Priest . No more be done : We should prophane the seruice of the dead , To sing sage Requiem , and such rest to her As to peace - parted Soules Laer . Lay her i ' th ' earth , And from her faire and vnpolluted flesh , May Violets spring . I tell thee ( churlish Priest ) A Ministring Angell shall my Sister be , When thou liest howling ? Ham . What , the faire Ophelia ? Queene . Sweets , to the sweet farewell . I hop ' d thou should ' st haue bin my Hamlets wife : I thought thy Bride - bed to haue deckt ( sweet Maid ) And not t ' haue strew ' d thy Graue Laer . Oh terrible woer , Fall ten times trebble , on that cursed head Whose wicked deed , thy most Ingenious sence Depriu ' d thee of . Hold off the earth a while , Till I haue caught her once more in mine armes : Leaps in the graue . Now pile your dust , vpon the quicke , and dead , Till of this flat a Mountaine you haue made , To o ' re top old Pelion , or the skyish head Of blew Olympus Ham . What is he , whose griefes Beares such an Emphasis ? whose phrase of Sorrow Coniure the wandring Starres , and makes them stand Like wonder - wounded hearers ? This is I , Hamlet the Dane Laer . The deuill take thy soule Ham . Thou prai ' st not well , I prythee take thy fingers from my throat ; Sir though I am not Spleenatiue , and rash , Yet haue I something in me dangerous , Which let thy wisenesse feare . Away thy hand King . Pluck them asunder Qu . Hamlet , Hamlet Gen . Good my Lord be quiet Ham . Why I will fight with him vppon this Theme . Vntill my eielids will no longer wag Qu . Oh my Sonne , what Theame ? Ham . I lou ' d Ophelia ; fortie thousand Brothers Could not ( with all there quantitie of Loue ) Make vp my summe . What wilt thou do for her ? King . Oh he is mad Laertes , Qu . For loue of God forbeare him Ham . Come show me what thou ' lt doe . Woo ' t weepe ? Woo ' t fight ? Woo ' t teare thy selfe ? Woo ' t drinke vp Esile , eate a Crocodile ? Ile doo ' t . Dost thou come heere to whine ; To outface me with leaping in her Graue ? Be buried quicke with her , and so will I . And if thou prate of Mountaines ; let them throw Millions of Akers on vs ; till our ground Sindging his pate against the burning Zone , Make Ossa like a wart . Nay , and thou ' lt mouth , Ile rant as well as thou Kin . This is meere Madnesse : And thus awhile the fit will worke on him : Anon as patient as the female Doue , When that her Golden Cuplet are disclos ' d ; His silence will sit drooping Ham . Heare you Sir : What is the reason that you vse me thus ? I lou ' d you euer ; but it is no matter : Let Hercules himselfe doe what he may , The Cat will Mew , and Dogge will haue his day . Enter . Kin . I pray you good Horatio wait vpon him , Strengthen your patience in our last nights speech , Wee ' l put the matter to the present push : Good Gertrude set some watch ouer your Sonne , This Graue shall haue a liuing Monument : An houre of quiet shortly shall we see ; Till then , in patience our proceeding be . Exeunt . Enter Hamlet and Horatio Ham . So much for this Sir ; now let me see the other , You doe remember all the Circumstance Hor . Remember it my Lord ? Ham . Sir , in my heart there was a kinde of fighting , That would not let me sleepe ; me thought I lay Worse then the mutines in the Bilboes , rashly , ( And praise be rashnesse for it ) let vs know , Our indiscretion sometimes serues vs well , When our deare plots do paule , and that should teach vs , There ' s a Diuinity that shapes our ends , Rough - hew them how we will Hor . That is most certaine Ham . Vp from my Cabin My sea - gowne scarft about me in the darke , Grop ' d I to finde out them ; had my desire , Finger ' d their Packet , and in fine , withdrew To mine owne roome againe , making so bold , ( My feares forgetting manners ) to vnseale Their grand Commission , where I found Horatio , Oh royall knauery : An exact command , Larded with many seuerall sorts of reason ; Importing Denmarks health , and Englands too , With hoo , such Bugges and Goblins in my life , That on the superuize no leasure bated , No not to stay the grinding of the Axe , My head should be struck off Hor . Ist possible ? Ham . Here ' s the Commission , read it at more leysure : But wilt thou heare me how I did proceed ? Hor . I beseech you Ham . Being thus benetted round with Villaines , Ere I could make a Prologue to my braines , They had begun the Play . I sate me downe , Deuis ' d a new Commission , wrote it faire , I once did hold it as our Statists doe , A basenesse to write faire ; and laboured much How to forget that learning : but Sir now , It did me Yeomans seriuce : wilt thou know The effects of what I wrote ? Hor . I , good my Lord Ham . An earnest Coniuration from the King , As England was his faithfull Tributary , As loue betweene them , as the Palme should flourish , As Peace should still her wheaten Garland weare , And stand a Comma ' tweene their amities , And many such like Assis of great charge , That on the view and know of these Contents , Without debatement further , more or lesse , He should the bearers put to sodaine death , Not shriuing time allowed Hor . How was this seal ' d ? Ham . Why , euen in that was Heauen ordinate ; I had my fathers Signet in my Purse , Which was the Modell of that Danish Seale : Folded the Writ vp in forme of the other , Subscrib ' d it , gau ' t th ' impression , plac ' t it safely , The changeling neuer knowne : Now , the next day Was our Sea Fight , and what to this was sement , Thou know ' st already Hor . So Guildensterne and Rosincrance , go too ' t Ham . Why man , they did make loue to this imployment They are not neere my Conscience ; their debate Doth by their owne insinuation grow : ' Tis dangerous , when the baser nature comes Betweene the passe , and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites Hor . Why , what a King is this ? Ham . Does it not , thinkst thee , stand me now vpon He that hath kil ' d my King , and whor ' d my Mother , Popt in betweene th ' election and my hopes , Throwne out his Angle for my proper life , And with such coozenage ; is ' t not perfect conscience , To quit him with this arme ? And is ' t not to be damn ' d To let this Canker of our nature come In further euill Hor . It must be shortly knowne to him from England What is the issue of the businesse there Ham . It will be short , The interim ' s mine , and a mans life ' s no more Then to say one : but I am very sorry good Horatio , That to Laertes I forgot my selfe ; For by the image of my Cause , I see The Portraiture of his ; Ile count his fauours : But sure the brauery of his griefe did put me Into a Towring passion Hor . Peace , who comes heere ? Enter young Osricke . Osr . Your Lordship is right welcome back to Denmarke Ham . I humbly thank you Sir , dost know this waterflie ? Hor . No my good Lord Ham . Thy state is the more gracious ; for ' tis a vice to know him : he hath much Land , and fertile ; let a Beast be Lord of Beasts , and his Crib shall stand at the Kings Messe ; ' tis a Chowgh ; but as I saw spacious in the possession of dirt Osr . Sweet Lord , if your friendship were at leysure , I should impart a thing to you from his Maiesty Ham . I will receiue it with all diligence of spirit ; put your Bonet to his right vse , ' tis for the head Osr . I thanke your Lordship , ' tis very hot Ham . No , beleeue mee ' tis very cold , the winde is Northerly Osr . It is indifferent cold my Lord indeed Ham . Mee thinkes it is very soultry , and hot for my Complexion Osr . Exceedingly , my Lord , it is very soultry , as ' twere I cannot tell how : but my Lord , his Maiesty bad me signifie to you , that he ha ' s laid a great wager on your head : Sir , this is the matter Ham . I beseech you remember Osr . Nay , in good faith , for mine ease in good faith : Sir , you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is at his weapon Ham . What ' s his weapon ? Osr . Rapier and dagger Ham . That ' s two of his weapons ; but well Osr . The sir King ha ' s wag ' d with him six Barbary horses , against the which he impon ' d as I take it , sixe French Rapiers and Poniards , with their assignes , as Girdle , Hangers or so : three of the Carriages infaith are very deare to fancy , very responsiue to the hilts , most delicate carriages , and of very liberall conceit Ham . What call you the Carriages ? Osr . The Carriages Sir , are the hangers Ham . The phrase would bee more Germaine to the matter : If we could carry Cannon by our sides ; I would it might be Hangers till then ; but on sixe Barbary Horses against sixe French Swords : their Assignes , and three liberall conceited Carriages , that ' s the French but against the Danish ; why is this impon ' d as you call it ? Osr . The King Sir , hath laid that in a dozen passes betweene you and him , hee shall not exceed you three hits ; He hath one twelue for mine , and that would come to imediate tryall , if your Lordship would vouchsafe the Answere Ham . How if I answere no ? Osr . I meane my Lord , the opposition of your person in tryall Ham . Sir , I will walke heere in the Hall ; if it please his Maiestie , ' tis the breathing time of day with me ; let the Foyles bee brought , the Gentleman willing , and the King hold his purpose ; I will win for him if I can : if not , Ile gaine nothing but my shame , and the odde hits Osr . Shall I redeliuer you ee ' n so ? Ham . To this effect Sir , after what flourish your nature will Osr . I commend my duty to your Lordship Ham . Yours , yours ; hee does well to commend it himselfe , there are no tongues else for ' s tongue Hor . This Lapwing runs away with the shell on his head Ham . He did Complie with his Dugge before hee suck ' t it : thus had he and mine more of the same Beauty that I know the drossie age dotes on ; only got the tune of the time , and outward habite of encounter , a kinde of yesty collection , which carries them through & through the most fond and winnowed opinions ; and doe but blow them to their tryalls : the Bubbles are out Hor . You will lose this wager , my Lord Ham . I doe not thinke so , since he went into France , I haue beene in continuall practice ; I shall winne at the oddes : but thou wouldest not thinke how all heere about my heart : but it is no matter Hor . Nay , good my Lord Ham . It is but foolery ; but it is such a kinde of gain - giuing as would perhaps trouble a woman Hor . If your minde dislike any thing , obey . I will forestall their repaire hither , and say you are not fit Ham . Not a whit , we defie Augury ; there ' s a speciall Prouidence in the fall of a sparrow . If it be now , ' tis not to come : if it bee not to come , it will bee now : if it be not now ; yet it will come ; the readinesse is all , since no man ha ' s ought of what he leaues . What is ' t to leaue betimes ? Enter King , Queene , Laertes and Lords , with other Attendants with Foyles , and Gauntlets , a Table and Flagons of Wine on it . Kin . Come Hamlet , come , and take this hand from me Ham . Giue me your pardon Sir , I ' ue done you wrong , But pardon ' t as you are a Gentleman . This presence knowes , And you must needs haue heard how I am punisht With sore distraction ? What I haue done That might your nature honour , and exception Roughly awake , I heere proclaime was madnesse : Was ' t Hamlet wrong ' d Laertes ? Neuer Hamlet . If Hamlet from himselfe be tane away : And when he ' s not himselfe , do ' s wrong Laertes , Then Hamlet does it not , Hamlet denies it : Who does it then ? His Madnesse ? If ' t be so , Hamlet is of the Faction that is wrong ' d , His madnesse is poore Hamlets Enemy . Sir , in this Audience , Let my disclaiming from a purpos ' d euill , Free me so farre in your most generous thoughts , That I haue shot mine Arrow o ' re the house , And hurt my Mother Laer . I am satisfied in Nature , Whose motiue in this case should stirre me most To my Reuenge . But in my termes of Honor I stand aloofe , and will no reconcilement , Till by some elder Masters of knowne Honor , I haue a voyce , and president of peace To keepe my name vngorg ' d . But till that time , I do receiue your offer ' d loue like loue , And wil not wrong it Ham . I do embrace it freely , And will this Brothers wager frankely play . Giue vs the Foyles : Come on Laer . Come one for me Ham . Ile be your foile Laertes , in mine ignorance , Your Skill shall like a Starre i ' th ' darkest night , Sticke fiery off indeede Laer . You mocke me Sir Ham . No by this hand King . Giue them the Foyles yong Osricke , Cousen Hamlet , you know the wager Ham . Verie well my Lord , Your Grace hath laide the oddes a ' th ' weaker side King . I do not feare it , I haue seene you both : But since he is better ' d , we haue therefore oddes Laer . This is too heauy , Let me see another Ham . This likes me well , These Foyles haue all a length . Prepare to play . Osricke . I my good Lord King . Set me the Stopes of wine vpon that Table : If Hamlet giue the first , or second hit , Or quit in answer of the third exchange , Let all the Battlements their Ordinance fire , The King shal drinke to Hamlets better breath , And in the Cup an vnion shal he throw Richer then that , which foure successiue Kings In Denmarkes Crowne haue worne . Giue me the Cups , And let the Kettle to the Trumpets speake , The Trumpet to the Cannoneer without , The Cannons to the Heauens , the Heauen to Earth , Now the King drinkes to Hamlet . Come , begin , And you the Iudges beare a wary eye Ham . Come on sir Laer . Come on sir . They play . Ham . One Laer . No Ham . Iudgement Osr . A hit , a very palpable hit Laer . Well : againe King . Stay , giue me drinke . Hamlet , this Pearle is thine , Here ' s to thy health . Giue him the cup , Trumpets sound , and shot goes off . Ham . Ile play this bout first , set by a - while . Come : Another hit ; what say you ? Laer . A touch , a touch , I do confesse King . Our Sonne shall win Qu . He ' s fat , and scant of breath . Heere ' s a Napkin , rub thy browes , The Queene Carowses to thy fortune , Hamlet Ham . Good Madam King . Gertrude , do not drinke Qu . I will my Lord ; I pray you pardon me King . It is the poyson ' d Cup , it is too late Ham . I dare not drinke yet Madam , By and by Qu . Come , let me wipe thy face Laer . My Lord , Ile hit him now King . I do not thinke ' t Laer . And yet ' tis almost ' gainst my conscience Ham . Come for the third . Laertes , you but dally , I pray you passe with your best violence , I am affear ' d you make a wanton of me Laer . Say you so ? Come on . Play . Osr . Nothing neither way Laer . Haue at you now . In scuffling they change Rapiers . King . Part them , they are incens ' d Ham . Nay come , againe Osr . Looke to the Queene there hoa Hor . They bleed on both sides . How is ' t my Lord ? Osr . How is ' t Laertes ? Laer . Why as a Woodcocke To mine Sprindge , Osricke , I am iustly kill ' d with mine owne Treacherie Ham . How does the Queene ? King . She sounds to see them bleede Qu . No , no , the drinke , the drinke . Oh my deere Hamlet , the drinke , the drinke , I am poyson ' d Ham . Oh Villany ! How ? Let the doore be lock ' d . Treacherie , seeke it out Laer . It is heere Hamlet . Hamlet , thou art slaine , No Medicine in the world can do thee good . In thee , there is not halfe an houre of life ; The Treacherous Instrument is in thy hand , Vnbated and envenom ' d : the foule practise Hath turn ' d it selfe on me . Loe , heere I lye , Neuer to rise againe : Thy Mothers poyson ' d : I can no more , the King , the King ' s too blame Ham . The point envenom ' d too , Then venome to thy worke . Hurts the King . All . Treason , Treason King . O yet defend me Friends , I am but hurt Ham . Heere thou incestuous , murdrous , Damned Dane , Drinke off this Potion : Is thy Vnion heere ? Follow my Mother . King Dyes . Laer . He is iustly seru ' d . It is a poyson temp ' red by himselfe : Exchange forgiuenesse with me , Noble Hamlet ; Mine and my Fathers death come not vpon thee , Nor thine on me . Dyes . Ham . Heauen make thee free of it , I follow thee . I am dead Horatio , wretched Queene adiew , You that looke pale , and tremble at this chance , That are but Mutes or audience to this acte : Had I but time ( as this fell Sergeant death Is strick ' d in his Arrest ) oh I could tell you . But let it be : Horatio , I am dead , Thou liu ' st , report me and my causes right To the vnsatisfied Hor . Neuer beleeue it . I am more an Antike Roman then a Dane : Heere ' s yet some Liquor left Ham . As th ' art a man , giue me the Cup . Let go , by Heauen Ile haue ' t . Oh good Horatio , what a wounded name , ( Things standing thus vnknowne ) shall liue behind me . If thou did ' st euer hold me in thy heart , Absent thee from felicitie awhile , And in this harsh world draw thy breath in paine , To tell my Storie . March afarre off , and shout within . What warlike noyse is this ? Enter Osricke . Osr . Yong Fortinbras , with conquest come fro [ m ] Poland To th ' Ambassadors of England giues this warlike volly Ham . O I dye Horatio : The potent poyson quite ore - crowes my spirit , I cannot liue to heare the Newes from England , But I do prophesie th ' election lights On Fortinbras , he ha ' s my dying voyce , So tell him with the occurrents more and lesse , Which haue solicited . The rest is silence . O , o , o , o . Dyes Hora . Now cracke a Noble heart : Goodnight sweet Prince , And flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest , Why do ' s the Drumme come hither ? Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassador , with Drumme , Colours , and Attendants . Fortin . Where is this sight ? Hor . What is it ye would see ; If ought of woe , or wonder , cease your search For . His quarry cries on hauocke . Oh proud death , What feast is toward in thine eternall Cell . That thou so many Princes , at a shoote , So bloodily hast strooke Amb . The sight is dismall , And our affaires from England come too late , The eares are senselesse that should giue vs hearing , To tell him his command ' ment is fulfill ' d , That Rosincrance and Guildensterne are dead : Where should we haue our thankes ? Hor . Not from his mouth , Had it th ' abilitie of life to thanke you : He neuer gaue command ' ment for their death . But since so iumpe vpon this bloodie question , You from the Polake warres , and you from England Are heere arriued . Giue order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view , And let me speake to th ' yet vnknowing world , How these things came about . So shall you heare Of carnall , bloudie , and vnnaturall acts , Of accidentall iudgements , casuall slaughters Of death ' s put on by cunning , and forc ' d cause , And in this vpshot , purposes mistooke , Falne on the Inuentors head . All this can I Truly deliuer For . Let vs hast to heare it , And call the Noblest to the Audience . For me , with sorrow , I embrace my Fortune , I haue some Rites of memory in this Kingdome , Which are to claime , my vantage doth Inuite me , Hor . Of that I shall haue alwayes cause to speake , And from his mouth Whose voyce will draw on more : But let this same be presently perform ' d , Euen whiles mens mindes are wilde , Lest more mischance On plots , and errors happen For . Let foure Captaines Beare Hamlet like a Soldier to the Stage , For he was likely , had he beene put on To haue prou ' d most royally : And for his passage , The Souldiours Musicke , and the rites of Warre Speake lowdly for him . Take vp the body ; Such a sight as this Becomes the Field , but heere shewes much amis . Go , bid the Souldiers shoote . Exeunt . Marching : after the which , a Peale of Ordenance are shot off . FINIS . The tragedie of HAMLET , Prince of Denmarke .\""

       "\"[ The Tragedie of Macbeth by William Shakespeare 1603 ] Actus Primus . Scoena Prima . Thunder and Lightning . Enter three Witches . 1 . When shall we three meet againe ? In Thunder , Lightning , or in Raine ? 2 . When the Hurley - burley ' s done , When the Battaile ' s lost , and wonne 3 . That will be ere the set of Sunne 1 . Where the place ? 2 . Vpon the Heath 3 . There to meet with Macbeth 1 . I come , Gray - Malkin All . Padock calls anon : faire is foule , and foule is faire , Houer through the fogge and filthie ayre . Exeunt . Scena Secunda . Alarum within . Enter King Malcome , Donalbaine , Lenox , with attendants , meeting a bleeding Captaine . King . What bloody man is that ? he can report , As seemeth by his plight , of the Reuolt The newest state Mal . This is the Serieant , Who like a good and hardie Souldier fought ' Gainst my Captiuitie : Haile braue friend ; Say to the King , the knowledge of the Broyle , As thou didst leaue it Cap . Doubtfull it stood , As two spent Swimmers , that doe cling together , And choake their Art : The mercilesse Macdonwald ( Worthie to be a Rebell , for to that The multiplying Villanies of Nature Doe swarme vpon him ) from the Westerne Isles Of Kernes and Gallowgrosses is supply ' d , And Fortune on his damned Quarry smiling , Shew ' d like a Rebells Whore : but all ' s too weake : For braue Macbeth ( well hee deserues that Name ) Disdayning Fortune , with his brandisht Steele , Which smoak ' d with bloody execution ( Like Valours Minion ) caru ' d out his passage , Till hee fac ' d the Slaue : Which neu ' r shooke hands , nor bad farwell to him , Till he vnseam ' d him from the Naue toth ' Chops , And fix ' d his Head vpon our Battlements King . O valiant Cousin , worthy Gentleman Cap . As whence the Sunne ' gins his reflection , Shipwracking Stormes , and direfull Thunders : So from that Spring , whence comfort seem ' d to come , Discomfort swells : Marke King of Scotland , marke , No sooner Iustice had , with Valour arm ' d , Compell ' d these skipping Kernes to trust their heeles , But the Norweyan Lord , surueying vantage , With furbusht Armes , and new supplyes of men , Began a fresh assault King . Dismay ' d not this our Captaines , Macbeth and Banquoh ? Cap . Yes , as Sparrowes , Eagles ; Or the Hare , the Lyon : If I say sooth , I must report they were As Cannons ouer - charg ' d with double Cracks , So they doubly redoubled stroakes vpon the Foe : Except they meant to bathe in reeking Wounds , Or memorize another Golgotha , I cannot tell : but I am faint , My Gashes cry for helpe King . So well thy words become thee , as thy wounds , They smack of Honor both : Goe get him Surgeons . Enter Rosse and Angus . Who comes here ? Mal . The worthy Thane of Rosse Lenox . What a haste lookes through his eyes ? So should he looke , that seemes to speake things strange Rosse . God saue the King King . Whence cam ' st thou , worthy Thane ? Rosse . From Fiffe , great King , Where the Norweyan Banners flowt the Skie , And fanne our people cold . Norway himselfe , with terrible numbers , Assisted by that most disloyall Traytor , The Thane of Cawdor , began a dismall Conflict , Till that Bellona ' s Bridegroome , lapt in proofe , Confronted him with selfe - comparisons , Point against Point , rebellious Arme ' gainst Arme , Curbing his lauish spirit : and to conclude , The Victorie fell on vs King . Great happinesse Rosse . That now Sweno , the Norwayes King , Craues composition : Nor would we deigne him buriall of his men , Till he disbursed , at Saint Colmes ynch , Ten thousand Dollars , to our generall vse King . No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceiue Our Bosome interest : Goe pronounce his present death , And with his former Title greet Macbeth Rosse . Ile see it done King . What he hath lost , Noble Macbeth hath wonne . Exeunt . Scena Tertia . Thunder . Enter the three Witches . 1 . Where hast thou beene , Sister ? 2 . Killing Swine 3 . Sister , where thou ? 1 . A Saylors Wife had Chestnuts in her Lappe , And mouncht , & mouncht , and mouncht : Giue me , quoth I . Aroynt thee , Witch , the rumpe - fed Ronyon cryes . Her Husband ' s to Aleppo gone , Master o ' th ' Tiger : But in a Syue Ile thither sayle , And like a Rat without a tayle , Ile doe , Ile doe , and Ile doe 2 . Ile giue thee a Winde 1 . Th ' art kinde 3 . And I another 1 . I my selfe haue all the other , And the very Ports they blow , All the Quarters that they know , I ' th ' Ship - mans Card . Ile dreyne him drie as Hay : Sleepe shall neyther Night nor Day Hang vpon his Pent - house Lid : He shall liue a man forbid : Wearie Seu ' nights , nine times nine , Shall he dwindle , peake , and pine : Though his Barke cannot be lost , Yet it shall be Tempest - tost . Looke what I haue 2 . Shew me , shew me 1 . Here I haue a Pilots Thumbe , Wrackt , as homeward he did come . Drum within . 3 . A Drumme , a Drumme : Macbeth doth come All . The weyward Sisters , hand in hand , Posters of the Sea and Land , Thus doe goe , about , about , Thrice to thine , and thrice to mine , And thrice againe , to make vp nine . Peace , the Charme ' s wound vp . Enter Macbeth and Banquo . Macb . So foule and faire a day I haue not seene Banquo . How farre is ' t call ' d to Soris ? What are these , So wither ' d , and so wilde in their attyre , That looke not like th ' Inhabitants o ' th ' Earth , And yet are on ' t ? Liue you , or are you aught That man may question ? you seeme to vnderstand me , By each at once her choppie finger laying Vpon her skinnie Lips : you should be Women , And yet your Beards forbid me to interprete That you are so Mac . Speake if you can : what are you ? 1 . All haile Macbeth , haile to thee Thane of Glamis 2 . All haile Macbeth , haile to thee Thane of Cawdor 3 . All haile Macbeth , that shalt be King hereafter Banq . Good Sir , why doe you start , and seeme to feare Things that doe sound so faire ? i ' th ' name of truth Are ye fantasticall , or that indeed Which outwardly ye shew ? My Noble Partner You greet with present Grace , and great prediction Of Noble hauing , and of Royall hope , That he seemes wrapt withall : to me you speake not . If you can looke into the Seedes of Time , And say , which Graine will grow , and which will not , Speake then to me , who neyther begge , nor feare Your fauors , nor your hate 1 . Hayle 2 . Hayle 3 . Hayle 1 . Lesser than Macbeth , and greater 2 . Not so happy , yet much happyer 3 . Thou shalt get Kings , though thou be none : So all haile Macbeth , and Banquo 1 . Banquo , and Macbeth , all haile Macb . Stay you imperfect Speakers , tell me more : By Sinells death , I know I am Thane of Glamis , But how , of Cawdor ? the Thane of Cawdor liues A prosperous Gentleman : And to be King , Stands not within the prospect of beleefe , No more then to be Cawdor . Say from whence You owe this strange Intelligence , or why Vpon this blasted Heath you stop our way With such Prophetique greeting ? Speake , I charge you . Witches vanish . Banq . The Earth hath bubbles , as the Water ha ' s , And these are of them : whither are they vanish ' d ? Macb . Into the Ayre : and what seem ' d corporall , Melted , as breath into the Winde . Would they had stay ' d Banq . Were such things here , as we doe speake about ? Or haue we eaten on the insane Root , That takes the Reason Prisoner ? Macb . Your Children shall be Kings Banq . You shall be King Macb . And Thane of Cawdor too : went it not so ? Banq . Toth ' selfe - same tune and words : who ' s here ? Enter Rosse and Angus . Rosse . The King hath happily receiu ' d , Macbeth , The newes of thy successe : and when he reades Thy personall Venture in the Rebels sight , His Wonders and his Prayses doe contend , Which should be thine , or his : silenc ' d with that , In viewing o ' re the rest o ' th ' selfe - same day , He findes thee in the stout Norweyan Rankes , Nothing afeard of what thy selfe didst make Strange Images of death , as thick as Tale Can post with post , and euery one did beare Thy prayses in his Kingdomes great defence , And powr ' d them downe before him Ang . Wee are sent , To giue thee from our Royall Master thanks , Onely to harrold thee into his sight , Not pay thee Rosse . And for an earnest of a greater Honor , He bad me , from him , call thee Thane of Cawdor : In which addition , haile most worthy Thane , For it is thine Banq . What , can the Deuill speake true ? Macb . The Thane of Cawdor liues : Why doe you dresse me in borrowed Robes ? Ang . Who was the Thane , liues yet , But vnder heauie Iudgement beares that Life , Which he deserues to loose . Whether he was combin ' d with those of Norway , Or did lyne the Rebell with hidden helpe , And vantage ; or that with both he labour ' d In his Countreyes wracke , I know not : But Treasons Capitall , confess ' d , and prou ' d , Haue ouerthrowne him Macb . Glamys , and Thane of Cawdor : The greatest is behinde . Thankes for your paines . Doe you not hope your Children shall be Kings , When those that gaue the Thane of Cawdor to me , Promis ' d no lesse to them Banq . That trusted home , Might yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne , Besides the Thane of Cawdor . But ' tis strange : And oftentimes , to winne vs to our harme , The Instruments of Darknesse tell vs Truths , Winne vs with honest Trifles , to betray ' s In deepest consequence . Cousins , a word , I pray you Macb . Two Truths are told , As happy Prologues to the swelling Act Of the Imperiall Theame . I thanke you Gentlemen : This supernaturall solliciting Cannot be ill ; cannot be good . If ill ? why hath it giuen me earnest of successe , Commencing in a Truth ? I am Thane of Cawdor . If good ? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion , Whose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire , And make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes , Against the vse of Nature ? Present Feares Are lesse then horrible Imaginings : My Thought , whose Murther yet is but fantasticall , Shakes so my single state of Man , That Function is smother ' d in surmise , And nothing is , but what is not Banq . Looke how our Partner ' s rapt Macb . If Chance will haue me King , Why Chance may Crowne me , Without my stirre Banq . New Honors come vpon him Like our strange Garments , cleaue not to their mould , But with the aid of vse Macb . Come what come may , Time , and the Houre , runs through the roughest Day Banq . Worthy Macbeth , wee stay vpon your leysure Macb . Giue me your fauour : My dull Braine was wrought with things forgotten . Kinde Gentlemen , your paines are registred , Where euery day I turne the Leafe , To reade them . Let vs toward the King : thinke vpon What hath chanc ' d : and at more time , The Interim hauing weigh ' d it , let vs speake Our free Hearts each to other Banq . Very gladly Macb . Till then enough : Come friends . Exeunt . Scena Quarta . Flourish . Enter King , Lenox , Malcolme , Donalbaine , and Attendants . King . Is execution done on Cawdor ? Or not those in Commission yet return ' d ? Mal . My Liege , they are not yet come back . But I haue spoke with one that saw him die : Who did report , that very frankly hee Confess ' d his Treasons , implor ' d your Highnesse Pardon , And set forth a deepe Repentance : Nothing in his Life became him , Like the leauing it . Hee dy ' de , As one that had beene studied in his death , To throw away the dearest thing he ow ' d , As ' twere a carelesse Trifle King . There ' s no Art , To finde the Mindes construction in the Face . He was a Gentleman , on whom I built An absolute Trust . Enter Macbeth , Banquo , Rosse , and Angus . O worthyest Cousin , The sinne of my Ingratitude euen now Was heauie on me . Thou art so farre before , That swiftest Wing of Recompence is slow , To ouertake thee . Would thou hadst lesse deseru ' d , That the proportion both of thanks , and payment , Might haue beene mine : onely I haue left to say , More is thy due , then more then all can pay Macb . The seruice , and the loyaltie I owe , In doing it , payes it selfe . Your Highnesse part , is to receiue our Duties : And our Duties are to your Throne , and State , Children , and Seruants ; which doe but what they should , By doing euery thing safe toward your Loue And Honor King . Welcome hither : I haue begun to plant thee , and will labour To make thee full of growing . Noble Banquo , That hast no lesse deseru ' d , nor must be knowne No lesse to haue done so : Let me enfold thee , And hold thee to my Heart Banq . There if I grow , The Haruest is your owne King . My plenteous Ioyes , Wanton in fulnesse , seeke to hide themselues In drops of sorrow . Sonnes , Kinsmen , Thanes , And you whose places are the nearest , know , We will establish our Estate vpon Our eldest , Malcolme , whom we name hereafter , The Prince of Cumberland : which Honor must Not vnaccompanied , inuest him onely , But signes of Noblenesse , like Starres , shall shine On all deseruers . From hence to Envernes , And binde vs further to you Macb . The Rest is Labor , which is not vs ' d for you : Ile be my selfe the Herbenger , and make ioyfull The hearing of my Wife , with your approach : So humbly take my leaue King . My worthy Cawdor Macb . The Prince of Cumberland : that is a step , On which I must fall downe , or else o ' re - leape , For in my way it lyes . Starres hide your fires , Let not Light see my black and deepe desires : The Eye winke at the Hand : yet let that bee , Which the Eye feares , when it is done to see . Enter . King . True worthy Banquo : he is full so valiant , And in his commendations , I am fed : It is a Banquet to me . Let ' s after him , Whose care is gone before , to bid vs welcome : It is a peerelesse Kinsman . Flourish . Exeunt . Scena Quinta . Enter Macbeths Wife alone with a Letter . Lady . They met me in the day of successe : and I haue learn ' d by the perfect ' st report , they haue more in them , then mortall knowledge . When I burnt in desire to question them further , they made themselues Ayre , into which they vanish ' d . Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it , came Missiues from the King , who all - hail ' d me Thane of Cawdor , by which Title before , these weyward Sisters saluted me , and referr ' d me to the comming on of time , with haile King that shalt be . This haue I thought good to deliuer thee ( my dearest Partner of Greatnesse ) that thou might ' st not loose the dues of reioycing by being ignorant of what Greatnesse is promis ' d thee . Lay it to thy heart and farewell . Glamys thou art , and Cawdor , and shalt be What thou art promis ' d : yet doe I feare thy Nature , It is too full o ' th ' Milke of humane kindnesse , To catch the neerest way . Thou would ' st be great , Art not without Ambition , but without The illnesse should attend it . What thou would ' st highly , That would ' st thou holily : would ' st not play false , And yet would ' st wrongly winne . Thould ' st haue , great Glamys , that which cryes , Thus thou must doe , if thou haue it ; And that which rather thou do ' st feare to doe , Then wishest should be vndone . High thee hither , That I may powre my Spirits in thine Eare , And chastise with the valour of my Tongue All that impeides thee from the Golden Round , Which Fate and Metaphysicall ayde doth seeme To haue thee crown ' d withall . Enter Messenger . What is your tidings ? Mess . The King comes here to Night Lady . Thou ' rt mad to say it . Is not thy Master with him ? who , wer ' t so , Would haue inform ' d for preparation Mess . So please you , it is true : our Thane is comming : One of my fellowes had the speed of him ; Who almost dead for breath , had scarcely more Then would make vp his Message Lady . Giue him tending , He brings great newes , Exit Messenger . The Rauen himselfe is hoarse , That croakes the fatall entrance of Duncan Vnder my Battlements . Come you Spirits , That tend on mortall thoughts , vnsex me here , And fill me from the Crowne to the Toe , top - full Of direst Crueltie : make thick my blood , Stop vp th ' accesse , and passage to Remorse , That no compunctious visitings of Nature Shake my fell purpose , nor keepe peace betweene Th ' effect , and hit . Come to my Womans Brests , And take my Milke for Gall , you murth ' ring Ministers , Where - euer , in your sightlesse substances , You wait on Natures Mischiefe . Come thick Night , And pall thee in the dunnest smoake of Hell , That my keene Knife see not the Wound it makes , Nor Heauen peepe through the Blanket of the darke , To cry , hold , hold . Enter Macbeth . Great Glamys , worthy Cawdor , Greater then both , by the all - haile hereafter , Thy Letters haue transported me beyond This ignorant present , and I feele now The future in the instant Macb . My dearest Loue , Duncan comes here to Night Lady . And when goes hence ? Macb . To morrow , as he purposes Lady . O neuer , Shall Sunne that Morrow see . Your Face , my Thane , is as a Booke , where men May reade strange matters , to beguile the time . Looke like the time , beare welcome in your Eye , Your Hand , your Tongue : looke like th ' innocent flower , But be the Serpent vnder ' t . He that ' s comming , Must be prouided for : and you shall put This Nights great Businesse into my dispatch , Which shall to all our Nights , and Dayes to come , Giue solely soueraigne sway , and Masterdome Macb . We will speake further , Lady . Onely looke vp cleare : To alter fauor , euer is to feare : Leaue all the rest to me . Exeunt . Scena Sexta . Hoboyes , and Torches . Enter King , Malcolme , Donalbaine , Banquo , Lenox , Macduff , Rosse , Angus , and Attendants . King . This Castle hath a pleasant seat , The ayre nimbly and sweetly recommends it selfe Vnto our gentle sences Banq . This Guest of Summer , The Temple - haunting Barlet does approue , By his loued Mansonry , that the Heauens breath Smells wooingly here : no Iutty frieze , Buttrice , nor Coigne of Vantage , but this Bird Hath made his pendant Bed , and procreant Cradle , Where they must breed , and haunt : I haue obseru ' d The ayre is delicate . Enter Lady . King . See , see our honor ' d Hostesse : The Loue that followes vs , sometime is our trouble , Which still we thanke as Loue . Herein I teach you , How you shall bid God - eyld vs for your paines , And thanke vs for your trouble Lady . All our seruice , In euery point twice done , and then done double , Were poore , and single Businesse , to contend Against those Honors deepe , and broad , Wherewith your Maiestie loades our House : For those of old , and the late Dignities , Heap ' d vp to them , we rest your Ermites King . Where ' s the Thane of Cawdor ? We courst him at the heeles , and had a purpose To be his Purueyor : But he rides well , And his great Loue ( sharpe as his Spurre ) hath holp him To his home before vs : Faire and Noble Hostesse We are your guest to night La . Your Seruants euer , Haue theirs , themselues , and what is theirs in compt , To make their Audit at your Highnesse pleasure , Still to returne your owne King . Giue me your hand : Conduct me to mine Host we loue him highly , And shall continue , our Graces towards him . By your leaue Hostesse . Exeunt . Scena Septima . Hoboyes . Torches . Enter a Sewer , and diuers Seruants with Dishes and Seruice ouer the Stage . Then enter Macbeth Macb . If it were done , when ' tis done , then ' twer well , It were done quickly : If th ' Assassination Could trammell vp the Consequence , and catch With his surcease , Successe : that but this blow Might be the be all , and the end all . Heere , But heere , vpon this Banke and Schoole of time , Wee ' ld iumpe the life to come . But in these Cases , We still haue iudgement heere , that we but teach Bloody Instructions , which being taught , returne To plague th ' Inuenter , this euen - handed Iustice Commends th ' Ingredience of our poyson ' d Challice To our owne lips . Hee ' s heere in double trust ; First , as I am his Kinsman , and his Subiect , Strong both against the Deed : Then , as his Host , Who should against his Murtherer shut the doore , Not beare the knife my selfe . Besides , this Duncane Hath borne his Faculties so meeke ; hath bin So cleere in his great Office , that his Vertues Will pleade like Angels , Trumpet - tongu ' d against The deepe damnation of his taking off : And Pitty , like a naked New - borne - Babe , Striding the blast , or Heauens Cherubin , hors ' d Vpon the sightlesse Curriors of the Ayre , Shall blow the horrid deed in euery eye , That teares shall drowne the winde . I haue no Spurre To pricke the sides of my intent , but onely Vaulting Ambition , which ore - leapes it selfe , And falles on th ' other . Enter Lady . How now ? What Newes ? La . He has almost supt : why haue you left the chamber ? Mac . Hath he ask ' d for me ? La . Know you not , he ha ' s ? Mac . We will proceed no further in this Businesse : He hath Honour ' d me of late , and I haue bought Golden Opinions from all sorts of people , Which would be worne now in their newest glosse , Not cast aside so soone La . Was the hope drunke , Wherein you drest your selfe ? Hath it slept since ? And wakes it now to looke so greene , and pale , At what it did so freely ? From this time , Such I account thy loue . Art thou affear ' d To be the same in thine owne Act , and Valour , As thou art in desire ? Would ' st thou haue that Which thou esteem ' st the Ornament of Life , And liue a Coward in thine owne Esteeme ? Letting I dare not , wait vpon I would , Like the poore Cat i ' th ' Addage Macb . Prythee peace : I dare do all that may become a man , Who dares do more , is none La . What Beast was ' t then That made you breake this enterprize to me ? When you durst do it , then you were a man : And to be more then what you were , you would Be so much more the man . Nor time , nor place Did then adhere , and yet you would make both : They haue made themselues , and that their fitnesse now Do ' s vnmake you . I haue giuen Sucke , and know How tender ' tis to loue the Babe that milkes me , I would , while it was smyling in my Face , Haue pluckt my Nipple from his Bonelesse Gummes , And dasht the Braines out , had I so sworne As you haue done to this Macb . If we should faile ? Lady . We faile ? But screw your courage to the sticking place , And wee ' le not fayle : when Duncan is asleepe , ( Whereto the rather shall his dayes hard Iourney Soundly inuite him ) his two Chamberlaines Will I with Wine , and Wassell , so conuince , That Memorie , the Warder of the Braine , Shall be a Fume , and the Receit of Reason A Lymbeck onely : when in Swinish sleepe , Their drenched Natures lyes as in a Death , What cannot you and I performe vpon Th ' vnguarded Duncan ? What not put vpon His spungie Officers ? who shall beare the guilt Of our great quell Macb . Bring forth Men - Children onely : For thy vndaunted Mettle should compose Nothing but Males . Will it not be receiu ' d , When we haue mark ' d with blood those sleepie two Of his owne Chamber , and vs ' d their very Daggers , That they haue don ' t ? Lady . Who dares receiue it other , As we shall make our Griefes and Clamor rore , Vpon his Death ? Macb . I am settled , and bend vp Each corporall Agent to this terrible Feat . Away , and mock the time with fairest show , False Face must hide what the false Heart doth know . Exeunt . Actus Secundus . Scena Prima . Enter Banquo , and Fleance , with a Torch before him . Banq . How goes the Night , Boy ? Fleance . The Moone is downe : I haue not heard the Clock Banq . And she goes downe at Twelue Fleance . I take ' t , ' tis later , Sir Banq . Hold , take my Sword : There ' s Husbandry in Heauen , Their Candles are all out : take thee that too . A heauie Summons lyes like Lead vpon me , And yet I would not sleepe : Mercifull Powers , restraine in me the cursed thoughts That Nature giues way to in repose . Enter Macbeth , and a Seruant with a Torch . Giue me my Sword : who ' s there ? Macb . A Friend Banq . What Sir , not yet at rest ? the King ' s a bed . He hath beene in vnusuall Pleasure , And sent forth great Largesse to your Offices . This Diamond he greetes your Wife withall , By the name of most kind Hostesse , And shut vp in measurelesse content Mac . Being vnprepar ' d , Our will became the seruant to defect , Which else should free haue wrought Banq . All ' s well . I dreamt last Night of the three weyward Sisters : To you they haue shew ' d some truth Macb . I thinke not of them : Yet when we can entreat an houre to serue , We would spend it in some words vpon that Businesse , If you would graunt the time Banq . At your kind ' st leysure Macb . If you shall cleaue to my consent , When ' tis , it shall make Honor for you Banq . So I lose none , In seeking to augment it , but still keepe My Bosome franchis ' d , and Allegeance cleare , I shall be counsail ' d Macb . Good repose the while Banq . Thankes Sir : the like to you . Exit Banquo . Macb . Goe bid thy Mistresse , when my drinke is ready , She strike vpon the Bell . Get thee to bed . Enter . Is this a Dagger , which I see before me , The Handle toward my Hand ? Come , let me clutch thee : I haue thee not , and yet I see thee still . Art thou not fatall Vision , sensible To feeling , as to sight ? or art thou but A Dagger of the Minde , a false Creation , Proceeding from the heat - oppressed Braine ? I see thee yet , in forme as palpable , As this which now I draw . Thou marshall ' st me the way that I was going , And such an Instrument I was to vse . Mine Eyes are made the fooles o ' th ' other Sences , Or else worth all the rest : I see thee still ; And on thy Blade , and Dudgeon , Gouts of Blood , Which was not so before . There ' s no such thing : It is the bloody Businesse , which informes Thus to mine Eyes . Now o ' re the one halfe World Nature seemes dead , and wicked Dreames abuse The Curtain ' d sleepe : Witchcraft celebrates Pale Heccats Offrings : and wither ' d Murther , Alarum ' d by his Centinell , the Wolfe , Whose howle ' s his Watch , thus with his stealthy pace , With Tarquins rauishing sides , towards his designe Moues like a Ghost . Thou sowre and firme - set Earth Heare not my steps , which they may walke , for feare Thy very stones prate of my where - about , And take the present horror from the time , Which now sutes with it . Whiles I threat , he liues : Words to the heat of deedes too cold breath giues . A Bell rings . I goe , and it is done : the Bell inuites me . Heare it not , Duncan , for it is a Knell , That summons thee to Heauen , or to Hell . Enter . Scena Secunda . Enter Lady . La . That which hath made the [ m ] drunk , hath made me bold : What hath quench ' d them , hath giuen me fire . Hearke , peace : it was the Owle that shriek ' d , The fatall Bell - man , which giues the stern ' st good - night . He is about it , the Doores are open : And the surfeted Groomes doe mock their charge With Snores . I haue drugg ' d their Possets , That Death and Nature doe contend about them , Whether they liue , or dye . Enter Macbeth . Macb . Who ' s there ? what hoa ? Lady . Alack , I am afraid they haue awak ' d , And ' tis not done : th ' attempt , and not the deed , Confounds vs : hearke : I lay ' d their Daggers ready , He could not misse ' em . Had he not resembled My Father as he slept , I had don ' t . My Husband ? Macb . I haue done the deed : Didst thou not heare a noyse ? Lady . I heard the Owle schreame , and the Crickets cry . Did not you speake ? Macb . When ? Lady . Now Macb . As I descended ? Lady . I Macb . Hearke , who lyes i ' th ' second Chamber ? Lady . Donalbaine Mac . This is a sorry sight Lady . A foolish thought , to say a sorry sight Macb . There ' s one did laugh in ' s sleepe , And one cry ' d Murther , that they did wake each other : I stood , and heard them : But they did say their Prayers , And addrest them againe to sleepe Lady . There are two lodg ' d together Macb . One cry ' d God blesse vs , and Amen the other , As they had seene me with these Hangmans hands : Listning their feare , I could not say Amen , When they did say God blesse vs Lady . Consider it not so deepely Mac . But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen ? I had most need of Blessing , and Amen stuck in my throat Lady . These deeds must not be thought After these wayes : so , it will make vs mad Macb . Me thought I heard a voyce cry , Sleep no more : Macbeth does murther Sleepe , the innocent Sleepe , Sleepe that knits vp the rauel ' d Sleeue of Care , The death of each dayes Life , sore Labors Bath , Balme of hurt Mindes , great Natures second Course , Chiefe nourisher in Life ' s Feast Lady . What doe you meane ? Macb . Still it cry ' d , Sleepe no more to all the House : Glamis hath murther ' d Sleepe , and therefore Cawdor Shall sleepe no more : Macbeth shall sleepe no more Lady . Who was it , that thus cry ' d ? why worthy Thane , You doe vnbend your Noble strength , to thinke So braine - sickly of things : Goe get some Water , And wash this filthie Witnesse from your Hand . Why did you bring these Daggers from the place ? They must lye there : goe carry them , and smeare The sleepie Groomes with blood Macb . Ile goe no more : I am afraid , to thinke what I haue done : Looke on ' t againe , I dare not Lady . Infirme of purpose : Giue me the Daggers : the sleeping , and the dead , Are but as Pictures : ' tis the Eye of Childhood , That feares a painted Deuill . If he doe bleed , Ile guild the Faces of the Groomes withall , For it must seeme their Guilt . Enter . Knocke within . Macb . Whence is that knocking ? How is ' t with me , when euery noyse appalls me ? What Hands are here ? hah : they pluck out mine Eyes . Will all great Neptunes Ocean wash this blood Cleane from my Hand ? no : this my Hand will rather The multitudinous Seas incarnardine , Making the Greene one , Red . Enter Lady . Lady . My Hands are of your colour : but I shame To weare a Heart so white . Knocke . I heare a knocking at the South entry : Retyre we to our Chamber : A little Water cleares vs of this deed . How easie is it then ? your Constancie Hath left you vnattended . Knocke . Hearke , more knocking . Get on your Night - Gowne , least occasion call vs , And shew vs to be Watchers : be not lost So poorely in your thoughts Macb . To know my deed , Knocke . ' Twere best not know my selfe . Wake Duncan with thy knocking : I would thou could ' st . Exeunt . Scena Tertia . Enter a Porter . Knocking within . Porter . Here ' s a knocking indeede : if a man were Porter of Hell Gate , hee should haue old turning the Key . Knock . Knock , Knock , Knock . Who ' s there i ' th ' name of Belzebub ? Here ' s a Farmer , that hang ' d himselfe on th ' expectation of Plentie : Come in time , haue Napkins enow about you , here you ' le sweat for ' t . Knock . Knock , knock . Who ' s there in th ' other Deuils Name ? Faith here ' s an Equiuocator , that could sweare in both the Scales against eyther Scale , who committed Treason enough for Gods sake , yet could not equiuocate to Heauen : oh come in , Equiuocator . Knock . Knock , Knock , Knock . Who ' s there ? ' Faith here ' s an English Taylor come hither , for stealing out of a French Hose : Come in Taylor , here you may rost your Goose . Knock . Knock , Knock . Neuer at quiet : What are you ? but this place is too cold for Hell . Ile Deuill - Porter it no further : I had thought to haue let in some of all Professions , that goe the Primrose way to th ' euerlasting Bonfire . Knock . Anon , anon , I pray you remember the Porter . Enter Macduff , and Lenox . Macd . Was it so late , friend , ere you went to Bed , That you doe lye so late ? Port . Faith Sir , we were carowsing till the second Cock : And Drinke , Sir , is a great prouoker of three things Macd . What three things does Drinke especially prouoke ? Port . Marry , Sir , Nose - painting , Sleepe , and Vrine . Lecherie , Sir , it prouokes , and vnprouokes : it prouokes the desire , but it takes away the performance . Therefore much Drinke may be said to be an Equiuocator with Lecherie : it makes him , and it marres him ; it sets him on , and it takes him off ; it perswades him , and dis - heartens him ; makes him stand too , and not stand too : in conclusion , equiuocates him in a sleepe , and giuing him the Lye , leaues him Macd . I beleeue , Drinke gaue thee the Lye last Night Port . That it did , Sir , i ' the very Throat on me : but I requited him for his Lye , and ( I thinke ) being too strong for him , though he tooke vp my Legges sometime , yet I made a Shift to cast him . Enter Macbeth . Macd . Is thy Master stirring ? Our knocking ha ' s awak ' d him : here he comes Lenox . Good morrow , Noble Sir Macb . Good morrow both Macd . Is the King stirring , worthy Thane ? Macb . Not yet Macd . He did command me to call timely on him , I haue almost slipt the houre Macb . Ile bring you to him Macd . I know this is a ioyfull trouble to you : But yet ' tis one Macb . The labour we delight in , Physicks paine : This is the Doore Macd . Ile make so bold to call , for ' tis my limitted seruice . Exit Macduffe . Lenox . Goes the King hence to day ? Macb . He does : he did appoint so Lenox . The Night ha ' s been vnruly : Where we lay , our Chimneys were blowne downe , And ( as they say ) lamentings heard i ' th ' Ayre ; Strange Schreemes of Death , And Prophecying , with Accents terrible , Of dyre Combustion , and confus ' d Euents , New hatch ' d toth ' wofull time . The obscure Bird clamor ' d the liue - long Night . Some say , the Earth was Feuorous , And did shake Macb . ' Twas a rough Night Lenox . My young remembrance cannot paralell A fellow to it . Enter Macduff . Macd . O horror , horror , horror , Tongue nor Heart cannot conceiue , nor name thee Macb . and Lenox . What ' s the matter ? Macd . Confusion now hath made his Master - peece : Most sacrilegious Murther hath broke ope The Lords anoynted Temple , and stole thence The Life o ' th ' Building Macb . What is ' t you say , the Life ? Lenox . Meane you his Maiestie ? Macd . Approch the Chamber , and destroy your sight With a new Gorgon . Doe not bid me speake : See , and then speake your selues : awake , awake , Exeunt . Macbeth and Lenox . Ring the Alarum Bell : Murther , and Treason , Banquo , and Donalbaine : Malcolme awake , Shake off this Downey sleepe , Deaths counterfeit , And looke on Death it selfe : vp , vp , and see The great Doomes Image : Malcolme , Banquo , As from your Graues rise vp , and walke like Sprights , To countenance this horror . Ring the Bell . Bell rings . Enter Lady . Lady . What ' s the Businesse ? That such a hideous Trumpet calls to parley The sleepers of the House ? speake , speake Macd . O gentle Lady , ' Tis not for you to heare what I can speake : The repetition in a Womans eare , Would murther as it fell . Enter Banquo . O Banquo , Banquo , Our Royall Master ' s murther ' d Lady . Woe , alas : What , in our House ? Ban . Too cruell , any where . Deare Duff , I prythee contradict thy selfe , And say , it is not so . Enter Macbeth , Lenox , and Rosse . Macb . Had I but dy ' d an houre before this chance , I had liu ' d a blessed time : for from this instant , There ' s nothing serious in Mortalitie : All is but Toyes : Renowne and Grace is dead , The Wine of Life is drawne , and the meere Lees Is left this Vault , to brag of . Enter Malcolme and Donalbaine . Donal . What is amisse ? Macb . You are , and doe not know ' t : The Spring , the Head , the Fountaine of your Blood Is stopt , the very Source of it is stopt Macd . Your Royall Father ' s murther ' d Mal . Oh , by whom ? Lenox . Those of his Chamber , as it seem ' d , had don ' t : Their Hands and Faces were all badg ' d with blood , So were their Daggers , which vnwip ' d , we found Vpon their Pillowes : they star ' d , and were distracted , No mans Life was to be trusted with them Macb . O , yet I doe repent me of my furie , That I did kill them Macd . Wherefore did you so ? Macb . Who can be wise , amaz ' d , temp ' rate , & furious , Loyall , and Neutrall , in a moment ? No man : Th ' expedition of my violent Loue Out - run the pawser , Reason . Here lay Duncan , His Siluer skinne , lac ' d with His Golden Blood , And his gash ' d Stabs , look ' d like a Breach in Nature , For Ruines wastfull entrance : there the Murtherers , Steep ' d in the Colours of their Trade ; their Daggers Vnmannerly breech ' d with gore : who could refraine , That had a heart to loue ; and in that heart , Courage , to make ' s loue knowne ? Lady . Helpe me hence , hoa Macd . Looke to the Lady Mal . Why doe we hold our tongues , That most may clayme this argument for ours ? Donal . What should be spoken here , Where our Fate hid in an augure hole , May rush , and seize vs ? Let ' s away , Our Teares are not yet brew ' d Mal . Nor our strong Sorrow Vpon the foot of Motion Banq . Looke to the Lady : And when we haue our naked Frailties hid , That suffer in exposure ; let vs meet , And question this most bloody piece of worke , To know it further . Feares and scruples shake vs : In the great Hand of God I stand , and thence , Against the vndivulg ' d pretence , I fight Of Treasonous Mallice Macd . And so doe I All . So all Macb . Let ' s briefely put on manly readinesse , And meet i ' th ' Hall together All . Well contented . Exeunt . Malc . What will you doe ? Let ' s not consort with them : To shew an vnfelt Sorrow , is an Office Which the false man do ' s easie . Ile to England Don . To Ireland , I : Our seperated fortune shall keepe vs both the safer : Where we are , there ' s Daggers in mens smiles ; The neere in blood , the neerer bloody Malc . This murtherous Shaft that ' s shot , Hath not yet lighted : and our safest way , Is to auoid the ayme . Therefore to Horse , And let vs not be daintie of leaue - taking , But shift away : there ' s warrant in that Theft , Which steales it selfe , when there ' s no mercie left . Exeunt . Scena Quarta . Enter Rosse , with an Old man . Old man . Threescore and ten I can remember well , Within the Volume of which Time , I haue seene Houres dreadfull , and things strange : but this sore Night Hath trifled former knowings Rosse . Ha , good Father , Thou seest the Heauens , as troubled with mans Act , Threatens his bloody Stage : byth ' Clock ' tis Day , And yet darke Night strangles the trauailing Lampe : Is ' t Nights predominance , or the Dayes shame , That Darknesse does the face of Earth intombe , When liuing Light should kisse it ? Old man . ' Tis vnnaturall , Euen like the deed that ' s done : On Tuesday last , A Faulcon towring in her pride of place , Was by a Mowsing Owle hawkt at , and kill ' d Rosse . And Duncans Horses , ( A thing most strange , and certaine ) Beauteous , and swift , the Minions of their Race , Turn ' d wilde in nature , broke their stalls , flong out , Contending ' gainst Obedience , as they would Make Warre with Mankinde Old man . ' Tis said , they eate each other Rosse . They did so : To th ' amazement of mine eyes that look ' d vpon ' t . Enter Macduffe . Heere comes the good Macduffe . How goes the world Sir , now ? Macd . Why see you not ? Ross . Is ' t known who did this more then bloody deed ? Macd . Those that Macbeth hath slaine Ross . Alas the day , What good could they pretend ? Macd . They were subborned , Malcolme , and Donalbaine the Kings two Sonnes Are stolne away and fled , which puts vpon them Suspition of the deed Rosse . ' Gainst Nature still , Thriftlesse Ambition , that will rauen vp Thine owne liues meanes : Then ' tis most like , The Soueraignty will fall vpon Macbeth Macd . He is already nam ' d , and gone to Scone To be inuested Rosse . Where is Duncans body ? Macd . Carried to Colmekill , The Sacred Store - house of his Predecessors , And Guardian of their Bones Rosse . Will you to Scone ? Macd . No Cosin , Ile to Fife Rosse . Well , I will thither Macd . Well may you see things wel done there : Adieu Least our old Robes sit easier then our new Rosse . Farewell , Father Old M . Gods benyson go with you , and with those That would make good of bad , and Friends of Foes . Exeunt . omnes Actus Tertius . Scena Prima . Enter Banquo . Banq . Thou hast it now , King , Cawdor , Glamis , all , As the weyard Women promis ' d , and I feare Thou playd ' st most fowly for ' t : yet it was saide It should not stand in thy Posterity , But that my selfe should be the Roote , and Father Of many Kings . If there come truth from them , As vpon thee Macbeth , their Speeches shine , Why by the verities on thee made good , May they not be my Oracles as well , And set me vp in hope . But hush , no more . Senit sounded . Enter Macbeth as King , Lady Lenox , Rosse , Lords , and Attendants . Macb . Heere ' s our chiefe Guest La . If he had beene forgotten , It had bene as a gap in our great Feast , And all - thing vnbecomming Macb . To night we hold a solemne Supper sir , And Ile request your presence Banq . Let your Highnesse Command vpon me , to the which my duties Are with a most indissoluble tye For euer knit Macb . Ride you this afternoone ? Ban . I , my good Lord Macb . We should haue else desir ' d your good aduice ( Which still hath been both graue , and prosperous ) In this dayes Councell : but wee ' le take to morrow . Is ' t farre you ride ? Ban . As farre , my Lord , as will fill vp the time ' Twixt this , and Supper . Goe not my Horse the better , I must become a borrower of the Night , For a darke houre , or twaine Macb . Faile not our Feast Ban . My Lord , I will not Macb . We heare our bloody Cozens are bestow ' d In England , and in Ireland , not confessing Their cruell Parricide , filling their hearers With strange inuention . But of that to morrow , When therewithall , we shall haue cause of State , Crauing vs ioyntly . Hye you to Horse : Adieu , till you returne at Night . Goes Fleance with you ? Ban . I , my good Lord : our time does call vpon ' s Macb . I wish your Horses swift , and sure of foot : And so I doe commend you to their backs . Farwell . Exit Banquo . Let euery man be master of his time , Till seuen at Night , to make societie The sweeter welcome : We will keepe our selfe till Supper time alone : While then , God be with you . Exeunt . Lords . Sirrha , a word with you : Attend those men Our pleasure ? Seruant . They are , my Lord , without the Pallace Gate Macb . Bring them before vs . Exit Seruant . To be thus , is nothing , but to be safely thus Our feares in Banquo sticke deepe , And in his Royaltie of Nature reignes that Which would be fear ' d . ' Tis much he dares , And to that dauntlesse temper of his Minde , He hath a Wisdome , that doth guide his Valour , To act in safetie . There is none but he , Whose being I doe feare : and vnder him , My Genius is rebuk ' d , as it is said Mark Anthonies was by Caesar . He chid the Sisters , When first they put the Name of King vpon me , And bad them speake to him . Then Prophet - like , They hayl ' d him Father to a Line of Kings . Vpon my Head they plac ' d a fruitlesse Crowne , And put a barren Scepter in my Gripe , Thence to be wrencht with an vnlineall Hand , No Sonne of mine succeeding : if ' t be so , For Banquo ' s Issue haue I fil ' d my Minde , For them , the gracious Duncan haue I murther ' d , Put Rancours in the Vessell of my Peace Onely for them , and mine eternall Iewell Giuen to the common Enemie of Man , To make them Kings , the Seedes of Banquo Kings . Rather then so , come Fate into the Lyst , And champion me to th ' vtterance . Who ' s there ? Enter Seruant , and two Murtherers . Now goe to the Doore , and stay there till we call . Exit Seruant . Was it not yesterday we spoke together ? Murth . It was , so please your Highnesse Macb . Well then , Now haue you consider ' d of my speeches : Know , that it was he , in the times past , Which held you so vnder fortune , Which you thought had been our innocent selfe . This I made good to you , in our last conference , Past in probation with you : How you were borne in hand , how crost : The Instruments : who wrought with them : And all things else , that might To halfe a Soule , and to a Notion craz ' d , Say , Thus did Banquo 1 . Murth . You made it knowne to vs Macb . I did so : And went further , which is now Our point of second meeting . Doe you finde your patience so predominant , In your nature , that you can let this goe ? Are you so Gospell ' d , to pray for this good man , And for his Issue , whose heauie hand Hath bow ' d you to the Graue , and begger ' d Yours for euer ? 1 . Murth . We are men , my Liege Macb . I , in the Catalogue ye goe for men , As Hounds , and Greyhounds , Mungrels , Spaniels , Curres , Showghes , Water - Rugs , and Demy - Wolues are clipt All by the Name of Dogges : the valued file Distinguishes the swift , the slow , the subtle , The House - keeper , the Hunter , euery one According to the gift , which bounteous Nature Hath in him clos ' d : whereby he does receiue Particular addition , from the Bill , That writes them all alike : and so of men . Now , if you haue a station in the file , Not i ' th ' worst ranke of Manhood , say ' t , And I will put that Businesse in your Bosomes , Whose execution takes your Enemie off , Grapples you to the heart ; and loue of vs , Who weare our Health but sickly in his Life , Which in his Death were perfect 2 . Murth . I am one , my Liege , Whom the vile Blowes and Buffets of the World Hath so incens ' d , that I am recklesse what I doe , To spight the World 1 . Murth . And I another , So wearie with Disasters , tugg ' d with Fortune , That I would set my Life on any Chance , To mend it , or be rid on ' t Macb . Both of you know Banquo was your Enemie Murth . True , my Lord Macb . So is he mine : and in such bloody distance , That euery minute of his being , thrusts Against my neer ' st of Life : and though I could With bare - fac ' d power sweepe him from my sight , And bid my will auouch it ; yet I must not , For certaine friends that are both his , and mine , Whose loues I may not drop , but wayle his fall , Who I my selfe struck downe : and thence it is , That I to your assistance doe make loue , Masking the Businesse from the common Eye , For sundry weightie Reasons 2 . Murth . We shall , my Lord , Performe what you command vs 1 . Murth . Though our Liues - Macb . Your Spirits shine through you . Within this houre , at most , I will aduise you where to plant your selues , Acquaint you with the perfect Spy o ' th ' time , The moment on ' t , for ' t must be done to Night , And something from the Pallace : alwayes thought , That I require a clearenesse ; and with him , To leaue no Rubs nor Botches in the Worke : Fleans , his Sonne , that keepes him companie , Whose absence is no lesse materiall to me , Then is his Fathers , must embrace the fate Of that darke houre : resolue your selues apart , Ile come to you anon Murth . We are resolu ' d , my Lord Macb . Ile call vpon you straight : abide within , It is concluded : Banquo , thy Soules flight , If it finde Heauen , must finde it out to Night . Exeunt . Scena Secunda . Enter Macbeths Lady , and a Seruant . Lady . Is Banquo gone from Court ? Seruant . I , Madame , but returnes againe to Night Lady . Say to the King , I would attend his leysure , For a few words Seruant . Madame , I will . Enter . Lady . Nought ' s had , all ' s spent . Where our desire is got without content : ' Tis safer , to be that which we destroy , Then by destruction dwell in doubtfull ioy . Enter Macbeth . How now , my Lord , why doe you keepe alone ? Of sorryest Fancies your Companions making , Vsing those Thoughts , which should indeed haue dy ' d With them they thinke on : things without all remedie Should be without regard : what ' s done , is done Macb . We haue scorch ' d the Snake , not kill ' d it : Shee ' le close , and be her selfe , whilest our poore Mallice Remaines in danger of her former Tooth . But let the frame of things dis - ioynt , Both the Worlds suffer , Ere we will eate our Meale in feare , and sleepe In the affliction of these terrible Dreames , That shake vs Nightly : Better be with the dead , Whom we , to gayne our peace , haue sent to peace , Then on the torture of the Minde to lye In restlesse extasie . Duncane is in his Graue : After Lifes fitfull Feuer , he sleepes well , Treason ha ' s done his worst : nor Steele , nor Poyson , Mallice domestique , forraine Leuie , nothing , Can touch him further Lady . Come on : Gentle my Lord , sleeke o ' re your rugged Lookes , Be bright and Iouiall among your Guests to Night Macb . So shall I Loue , and so I pray be you : Let your remembrance apply to Banquo , Present him Eminence , both with Eye and Tongue : Vnsafe the while , that wee must laue Our Honors in these flattering streames , And make our Faces Vizards to our Hearts , Disguising what they are Lady . You must leaue this Macb . O , full of Scorpions is my Minde , deare Wife : Thou know ' st , that Banquo and his Fleans liues Lady . But in them , Natures Coppie ' s not eterne Macb . There ' s comfort yet , they are assaileable , Then be thou iocund : ere the Bat hath flowne His Cloyster ' d flight , ere to black Heccats summons The shard - borne Beetle , with his drowsie hums , Hath rung Nights yawning Peale , There shall be done a deed of dreadfull note Lady . What ' s to be done ? Macb . Be innocent of the knowledge , dearest Chuck , Till thou applaud the deed : Come , seeling Night , Skarfe vp the tender Eye of pittifull Day , And with thy bloodie and inuisible Hand Cancell and teare to pieces that great Bond , Which keepes me pale . Light thickens , And the Crow makes Wing toth ' Rookie Wood : Good things of Day begin to droope , and drowse , Whiles Nights black Agents to their Prey ' s doe rowse . Thou maruell ' st at my words : but hold thee still , Things bad begun , make strong themselues by ill : So prythee goe with me . Exeunt . Scena Tertia . Enter three Murtherers . 1 . But who did bid thee ioyne with vs ? 3 . Macbeth 2 . He needes not our mistrust , since he deliuers Our Offices , and what we haue to doe , To the direction iust 1 . Then stand with vs : The West yet glimmers with some streakes of Day . Now spurres the lated Traueller apace , To gayne the timely Inne , and neere approches The subiect of our Watch 3 .

You know your owne degrees , sit downe : At first and last , the hearty welcome Lords . Thankes to your Maiesty Macb .

Then comes my Fit againe : I had else beene perfect ; Whole as the Marble , founded as the Rocke , As broad , and generall , as the casing Ayre : But now I am cabin ' d , crib ' d , confin ' d , bound in To sawcy doubts , and feares . But Banquo ' s safe ? Mur . I , my good Lord : safe in a ditch he bides , With twenty trenched gashes on his head ; The least a Death to Nature Macb . Thankes for that : There the growne Serpent lyes , the worme that ' s fled Hath Nature that in time will Venom breed , No teeth for th ' present . Get thee gone , to morrow Wee ' l heare our selues againe . Exit Murderer . Lady . My Royall Lord , You do not giue the Cheere , the Feast is sold That is not often vouch ' d , while ' tis a making : ' Tis giuen , with welcome : to feede were best at home : From thence , the sawce to meate is Ceremony , Meeting were bare without it .

Lenox . Heere my good Lord . What is ' t that moues your Highnesse ? Macb . Which of you haue done this ? Lords . What , my good Lord ? Macb . Thou canst not say I did it : neuer shake Thy goary lockes at me Rosse . Gentlemen rise , his Highnesse is not well Lady . Sit worthy Friends : my Lord is often thus , And hath beene from his youth . Pray you keepe Seat , The fit is momentary , vpon a thought He will againe be well . If much you note him You shall offend him , and extend his Passion , Feed , and regard him not . Are you a man ? Macb . I , and a bold one , that dare looke on that Which might appall the Diuell La . O proper stuffe : This is the very painting of your feare : This is the Ayre - drawne - Dagger which you said Led you to Duncan . O , these flawes and starts ( Impostors to true feare ) would well become A womans story , at a Winters fire Authoriz ' d by her Grandam : shame it selfe , Why do you make such faces ? When all ' s done You looke but on a stoole Macb . Prythee see there : Behold , looke , loe , how say you : Why what care I , if thou canst nod , speake too . If Charnell houses , and our Graues must send Those that we bury , backe ; our Monuments Shall be the Mawes of Kytes La . What ? quite vnmann ' d in folly Macb . If I stand heere , I saw him La . Fie for shame Macb . Blood hath bene shed ere now , i ' th ' olden time Ere humane Statute purg ' d the gentle Weale : I , and since too , Murthers haue bene perform ' d Too terrible for the eare . The times has bene , That when the Braines were out , the man would dye , And there an end : But now they rise againe With twenty mortall murthers on their crownes , And push vs from our stooles . This is more strange Then such a murther is La . My worthy Lord Your Noble Friends do lacke you Macb . I do forget : Do not muse at me my most worthy Friends , I haue a strange infirmity , which is nothing To those that know me . Come , loue and health to all , Then Ile sit downe : Giue me some Wine , fill full : Enter Ghost .

What man dare , I dare : Approach thou like the rugged Russian Beare , The arm ' d Rhinoceros , or th ' Hircan Tiger , Take any shape but that , and my firme Nerues Shall neuer tremble . Or be aliue againe , And dare me to the Desart with thy Sword : If trembling I inhabit then , protest mee The Baby of a Girle . Hence horrible shadow , Vnreall mock ' ry hence . Why so , being gone I am a man againe : pray you sit still La . You haue displac ' d the mirth , Broke the good meeting , with most admir ' d disorder Macb . Can such things be , And ouercome vs like a Summers Clowd , Without our speciall wonder ? You make me strange Euen to the disposition that I owe , When now I thinke you can behold such sights , And keepe the naturall Rubie of your Cheekes , When mine is blanch ' d with feare Rosse . What sights , my Lord ? La . I pray you speake not : he growes worse & worse Question enrages him : at once , goodnight . Stand not vpon the order of your going , But go at once Len . Good night , and better health Attend his Maiesty La . A kinde goodnight to all . Exit Lords . Macb . It will haue blood they say : Blood will haue Blood : Stones haue beene knowne to moue , & Trees to speake : Augures , and vnderstood Relations , haue By Maggot Pyes , & Choughes , & Rookes brought forth The secret ' st man of Blood . What is the night ? La . Almost at oddes with morning , which is which Macb . How say ' st thou that Macduff denies his person At our great bidding La . Did you send to him Sir ? Macb . I heare it by the way : But I will send : There ' s not a one of them but in his house I keepe a Seruant Feed . I will to morrow ( And betimes I will ) to the weyard Sisters . More shall they speake : for now I am bent to know By the worst meanes , the worst , for mine owne good , All causes shall giue way . I am in blood Stept in so farre , that should I wade no more , Returning were as tedious as go ore : Strange things I haue in head , that will to hand , Which must be acted , ere they may be scand La .

Scena Quinta . Thunder . Enter the three Witches , meeting Hecat . 1 . Why how now Hecat , you looke angerly ? Hec . Haue I not reason ( Beldams ) as you are ? Sawcy , and ouer - bold , how did you dare To Trade , and Trafficke with Macbeth , In Riddles , and Affaires of death ; And I the Mistris of your Charmes , The close contriuer of all harmes , Was neuer call ' d to beare my part , Or shew the glory of our Art ? And which is worse , all you haue done Hath bene but for a wayward Sonne , Spightfull , and wrathfull , who ( as others do ) Loues for his owne ends , not for you . But make amends now : Get you gon , And at the pit of Acheron Meete me i ' th ' Morning : thither he Will come , to know his Destinie . Your Vessels , and your Spels prouide , Your Charmes , and euery thing beside ; I am for th ' Ayre : This night Ile spend Vnto a dismall , and a Fatall end . Great businesse must be wrought ere Noone . Vpon the Corner of the Moone There hangs a vap ' rous drop , profound , Ile catch it ere it come to ground ; And that distill ' d by Magicke slights , Shall raise such Artificiall Sprights , As by the strength of their illusion , Shall draw him on to his Confusion . He shall spurne Fate , scorne Death , and beare His hopes ' boue Wisedome , Grace , and Feare : And you all know , Security Is Mortals cheefest Enemie . Musicke , and a Song . Hearke , I am call ' d : my little Spirit see Sits in Foggy cloud , and stayes for me . Sing within . Come away , come away , & c . 1 Come , let ' s make hast , shee ' l soone be Backe againe . Exeunt . Scaena Sexta . Enter Lenox , and another Lord . Lenox . My former Speeches , Haue but hit your Thoughts Which can interpret farther : Onely I say Things haue bin strangely borne . The gracious Duncan Was pittied of Macbeth : marry he was dead : And the right valiant Banquo walk ' d too late , Whom you may say ( if ' t please you ) Fleans kill ' d , For Fleans fled : Men must not walke too late . Who cannot want the thought , how monstrous It was for Malcolme , and for Donalbane To kill their gracious Father ? Damned Fact , How it did greeue Macbeth ? Did he not straight In pious rage , the two delinquents teare , That were the Slaues of drinke , and thralles of sleepe ? Was not that Nobly done ? I , and wisely too : For ' twould haue anger ' d any heart aliue To heare the men deny ' t . So that I say , He ha ' s borne all things well , and I do thinke , That had he Duncans Sonnes vnder his Key , ( As , and ' t please Heauen he shall not ) they should finde What ' twere to kill a Father : So should Fleans . But peace ; for from broad words , and cause he fayl ' d His presence at the Tyrants Feast , I heare Macduffe liues in disgrace . Sir , can you tell Where he bestowes himselfe ? Lord . The Sonnes of Duncane ( From whom this Tyrant holds the due of Birth ) Liues in the English Court , and is receyu ' d Of the most Pious Edward , with such grace , That the maleuolence of Fortune , nothing Takes from his high respect . Thither Macduffe Is gone , to pray the Holy King , vpon his ayd To wake Northumberland , and warlike Seyward , That by the helpe of these ( with him aboue ) To ratifie the Worke ) we may againe Giue to our Tables meate , sleepe to our Nights : Free from our Feasts , and Banquets bloody kniues ; Do faithfull Homage , and receiue free Honors , All which we pine for now . And this report Hath so exasperate their King , that hee Prepares for some attempt of Warre Len . Sent he to Macduffe ? Lord . He did : and with an absolute Sir , not I The clowdy Messenger turnes me his backe , And hums ; as who should say , you ' l rue the time That clogges me with this Answer Lenox . And that well might Aduise him to a Caution , t ' hold what distance His wisedome can prouide . Some holy Angell Flye to the Court of England , and vnfold His Message ere he come , that a swift blessing May soone returne to this our suffering Country , Vnder a hand accurs ' d Lord .

Then liue Macduffe : what need I feare of thee ? But yet Ile make assurance : double sure , And take a Bond of Fate : thou shalt not liue , That I may tell pale - hearted Feare , it lies ; And sleepe in spight of Thunder . Thunder 3 Apparation , a Childe Crowned , with a Tree in his hand . What is this , that rises like the issue of a King , And weares vpon his Baby - brow , the round And top of Soueraignty ? All . Listen , but speake not too ' t 3 Appar . Be Lyon metled , proud , and take no care : Who chafes , who frets , or where Conspirers are : Macbeth shall neuer vanquish ' d be , vntill Great Byrnam Wood , to high Dunsmane Hill Shall come against him . Descend . Macb . That will neuer bee : Who can impresse the Forrest , bid the Tree Vnfixe his earth - bound Root ? Sweet boadments , good : Rebellious dead , rise neuer till the Wood Of Byrnan rise , and our high plac ' d Macbeth Shall liue the Lease of Nature , pay his breath To time , and mortall Custome . Yet my Hart Throbs to know one thing : Tell me , if your Art Can tell so much : Shall Banquo ' s issue euer Reigne in this Kingdome ? All . Seeke to know no more Macb . I will be satisfied . Deny me this , And an eternall Curse fall on you : Let me know . Why sinkes that Caldron ? & what noise is this ? Hoboyes 1 Shew 2 Shew 3 Shew All . Shew his Eyes , and greeue his Hart , Come like shadowes , so depart . A shew of eight Kings , and Banquo last , with a glasse in his hand . Macb . Thou art too like the Spirit of Banquo : Down : Thy Crowne do ' s seare mine Eye - bals . And thy haire Thou other Gold - bound - brow , is like the first : A third , is like the former . Filthy Hagges , Why do you shew me this ? - A fourth ? Start eyes ! What will the Line stretch out to ' th ' cracke of Doome ? Another yet ? A seauenth ? Ile see no more : And yet the eighth appeares , who beares a glasse , Which shewes me many more : and some I see , That two - fold Balles , and trebble Scepters carry . Horrible sight : Now I see ' tis true , For the Blood - bolter ' d Banquo smiles vpon me , And points at them for his . What ? is this so ? 1 I Sir , all this is so . But why Stands Macbeth thus amazedly ? Come Sisters , cheere we vp his sprights , And shew the best of our delights . Ile Charme the Ayre to giue a sound , While you performe your Antique round : That this great King may kindly say , Our duties , did his welcome pay . Musicke . The Witches Dance , and vanish .

Saw you the Weyard Sisters ? Lenox . No my Lord Macb . Came they not by you ? Lenox . No indeed my Lord Macb . Infected be the Ayre whereon they ride , And damn ' d all those that trust them . I did heare The gallopping of Horse . Who was ' t came by ? Len . ' Tis two or three my Lord , that bring you word : Macduff is fled to England Macb . Fled to England ? Len . I , my good Lord Macb . Time , thou anticipat ' st my dread exploits : The flighty purpose neuer is o ' re - tooke Vnlesse the deed go with it . From this moment , The very firstlings of my heart shall be The firstlings of my hand . And euen now To Crown my thoughts with Acts : be it thoght & done : The Castle of Macduff , I will surprize . Seize vpon Fife ; giue to th ' edge o ' th ' Sword His Wife , his Babes , and all vnfortunate Soules That trace him in his Line . No boasting like a Foole , This deed Ile do , before this purpose coole , But no more sights . Where are these Gentlemen ? Come bring me where they are . Exeunt . Scena Secunda . Enter Macduffes Wife , her Son , and Rosse . Wife . What had he done , to make him fly the Land ? Rosse . You must haue patience Madam Wife . He had none : His flight was madnesse : when our Actions do not , Our feares do make vs Traitors Rosse . You know not Whether it was his wisedome , or his feare Wife . Wisedom ? to leaue his wife , to leaue his Babes , His Mansion , and his Titles , in a place From whence himselfe do ' s flye ? He loues vs not , He wants the naturall touch . For the poore Wren ( The most diminitiue of Birds ) will fight , Her yong ones in her Nest , against the Owle : All is the Feare , and nothing is the Loue ; As little is the Wisedome , where the flight So runnes against all reason Rosse . My deerest Cooz , I pray you schoole your selfe . But for your Husband , He is Noble , Wise , Iudicious , and best knowes The fits o ' th ' Season . I dare not speake much further , But cruell are the times , when we are Traitors And do not know our selues : when we hold Rumor From what we feare , yet know not what we feare , But floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea Each way , and moue . I take my leaue of you : Shall not be long but Ile be heere againe : Things at the worst will cease , or else climbe vpward , To what they were before . My pretty Cosine , Blessing vpon you Wife . Father ' d he is , And yet hee ' s Father - lesse Rosse . I am so much a Foole , should I stay longer It would be my disgrace , and your discomfort . I take my leaue at once . Exit Rosse . Wife . Sirra , your Fathers dead , And what will you do now ? How will you liue ? Son . As Birds do Mother Wife . What with Wormes , and Flyes ? Son . With what I get I meane , and so do they Wife . Poore Bird , Thou ' dst neuer Feare the Net , nor Lime , The Pitfall , nor the Gin Son . Why should I Mother ? Poore Birds they are not set for : My Father is not dead for all your saying Wife . Yes , he is dead : How wilt thou do for a Father ? Son . Nay how will you do for a Husband ? Wife . Why I can buy me twenty at any Market Son . Then you ' l by ' em to sell againe Wife . Thou speak ' st withall thy wit , And yet I ' faith with wit enough for thee Son . Was my Father a Traitor , Mother ? Wife . I , that he was Son . What is a Traitor ? Wife . Why one that sweares , and lyes Son . And be all Traitors , that do so Wife . Euery one that do ' s so , is a Traitor , And must be hang ' d Son . And must they all be hang ' d , that swear and lye ? Wife . Euery one Son . Who must hang them ? Wife . Why , the honest men Son . Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools : for there are Lyars and Swearers enow , to beate the honest men , and hang vp them Wife . Now God helpe thee , poore Monkie : But how wilt thou do for a Father ? Son . If he were dead , youl ' d weepe for him : if you would not , it were a good signe , that I should quickely haue a new Father Wife . Poore pratler , how thou talk ' st ? Enter a Messenger . Mes . Blesse you faire Dame : I am not to you known , Though in your state of Honor I am perfect ; I doubt some danger do ' s approach you neerely . If you will take a homely mans aduice , Be not found heere : Hence with your little ones To fright you thus . Me thinkes I am too sauage : To do worse to you , were fell Cruelty , Which is too nie your person . Heauen preserue you , I dare abide no longer . Exit Messenger Wife . Whether should I flye ? I haue done no harme . But I remember now I am in this earthly world : where to do harme Is often laudable , to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly . Why then ( alas ) Do I put vp that womanly defence , To say I haue done no harme ? What are these faces ? Enter Murtherers . Mur . Where is your Husband ? Wife . I hope in no place so vnsanctified , Where such as thou may ' st finde him Mur . He ' s a Traitor Son . Thou ly ' st thou shagge - ear ' d Villaine Mur . What you Egge ? Yong fry of Treachery ? Son . He ha ' s kill ' d me Mother , Run away I pray you . Exit crying Murther . Scaena Tertia . Enter Malcolme and Macduffe . Mal . Let vs seeke out some desolate shade , & there Weepe our sad bosomes empty Macd . Let vs rather Hold fast the mortall Sword : and like good men , Bestride our downfall Birthdome : each new Morne , New Widdowes howle , new Orphans cry , new sorowes Strike heauen on the face , that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland , and yell ' d out Like Syllable of Dolour Mal . What I beleeue , Ile waile ; What know , beleeue ; and what I can redresse , As I shall finde the time to friend : I wil . What you haue spoke , it may be so perchance . This Tyrant , whose sole name blisters our tongues , Was once thought honest : you haue lou ' d him well , He hath not touch ' d you yet . I am yong , but something You may discerne of him through me , and wisedome To offer vp a weake , poore innocent Lambe T ' appease an angry God Macd . I am not treacherous Malc . But Macbeth is . A good and vertuous Nature may recoyle In an Imperiall charge . But I shall craue your pardon : That which you are , my thoughts cannot transpose ; Angels are bright still , though the brightest fell . Though all things foule , would wear the brows of grace Yet Grace must still looke so Macd . I haue lost my Hopes Malc . Perchance euen there Where I did finde my doubts . Why in that rawnesse left you Wife , and Childe ? Those precious Motiues , those strong knots of Loue , Without leaue - taking . I pray you , Let not my Iealousies , be your Dishonors , But mine owne Safeties : you may be rightly iust , What euer I shall thinke Macd . Bleed , bleed poore Country , Great Tyrrany , lay thou thy basis sure , For goodnesse dare not check thee : wear y thy wrongs , The Title , is affear ' d . Far thee well Lord , I would not be the Villaine that thou think ' st , For the whole Space that ' s in the Tyrants Graspe , And the rich East to boot Mal . Be not offended : I speake not as in absolute feare of you : I thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake , It weepes , it bleeds , and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds . I thinke withall , There would be hands vplifted in my right : And heere from gracious England haue I offer Of goodly thousands . But for all this , When I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head , Or weare it on my Sword ; yet my poore Country Shall haue more vices then it had before , More suffer , and more sundry wayes then euer , By him that shall succeede Macd . What should he be ? Mal . It is my selfe I meane : in whom I know All the particulars of Vice so grafted , That when they shall be open ' d , blacke Macbeth Will seeme as pure as Snow , and the poore State Esteeme him as a Lambe , being compar ' d With my confinelesse harmes Macd . Not in the Legions Of horrid Hell , can come a Diuell more damn ' d In euils , to top Macbeth Mal . I grant him Bloody , Luxurious , Auaricious , False , Deceitfull , Sodaine , Malicious , smacking of euery sinne That ha ' s a name . But there ' s no bottome , none In my Voluptuousnesse : Your Wiues , your Daughters , Your Matrons , and your Maides , could not fill vp The Cesterne of my Lust , and my Desire All continent Impediments would ore - beare That did oppose my will . Better Macbeth , Then such an one to reigne Macd . Boundlesse intemperance In Nature is a Tyranny : It hath beene Th ' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne , And fall of many Kings . But feare not yet To take vpon you what is yours : you may Conuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty , And yet seeme cold . The time you may so hoodwinke : We haue willing Dames enough : there cannot be That Vulture in you , to deuoure so many As will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues , Finding it so inclinde Mal . With this , there growes In my most ill - composd Affection , such A stanchlesse Auarice , that were I King , I should cut off the Nobles for their Lands , Desire his Iewels , and this others House , And my more - hauing , would be as a Sawce To make me hunger more , that I should forge Quarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall , Destroying them for wealth Macd . This Auarice stickes deeper : growes with more pernicious roote Then Summer - seeming Lust : and it hath bin The Sword of our slaine Kings : yet do not feare , Scotland hath Foysons , to fill vp your will Of your meere Owne . All these are portable , With other Graces weigh ' d Mal . But I haue none . The King - becoming Graces , As Iustice , Verity , Temp ' rance , Stablenesse , Bounty , Perseuerance , Mercy , Lowlinesse , Deuotion , Patience , Courage , Fortitude , I haue no rellish of them , but abound In the diuision of each seuerall Crime , Acting it many wayes . Nay , had I powre , I should Poure the sweet Milke of Concord , into Hell , Vprore the vniuersall peace , confound All vnity on earth Macd . O Scotland , Scotland Mal . If such a one be fit to gouerne , speake : I am as I haue spoken Mac . Fit to gouern ? No not to liue . O Natio [ n ] miserable ! With an vntitled Tyrant , bloody Sceptred , When shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe ? Since that the truest Issue of thy Throne By his owne Interdiction stands accust , And do ' s blaspheme his breed ? Thy Royall Father Was a most Sainted - King : the Queene that bore thee , Oftner vpon her knees , then on her feet , Dy ' de euery day she liu ' d . Fare thee well , These Euils thou repeat ' st vpon thy selfe , Hath banish ' d me from Scotland . O my Brest , Thy hope ends heere Mal . Macduff , this Noble passion Childe of integrity , hath from my soule Wip ' d the blacke Scruples , reconcil ' d my thoughts To thy good Truth , and Honor . Diuellish Macbeth , By many of these traines , hath sought to win me Into his power : and modest Wisedome pluckes me From ouer - credulous hast : but God aboue Deale betweene thee and me ; For euen now I put my selfe to thy Direction , and Vnspeake mine owne detraction . Heere abiure The taints , and blames I laide vpon my selfe , For strangers to my Nature . I am yet Vnknowne to Woman , neuer was forsworne , Scarsely haue coueted what was mine owne . At no time broke my Faith , would not betray The Deuill to his Fellow , and delight No lesse in truth then life . My first false speaking Was this vpon my selfe . What I am truly Is thine , and my poore Countries to command : Whither indeed , before they heere approach Old Seyward with ten thousand warlike men Already at a point , was setting foorth : Now wee ' l together , and the chance of goodnesse Be like our warranted Quarrell . Why are you silent ? Macd . Such welcome , and vnwelcom things at once ' Tis hard to reconcile . Enter a Doctor . Mal . Well , more anon . Comes the King forth I pray you ? Doct . I Sir : there are a crew of wretched Soules That stay his Cure : their malady conuinces The great assay of Art . But at his touch , Such sanctity hath Heauen giuen his hand , They presently amend . Enter . Mal . I thanke you Doctor Macd . What ' s the Disease he meanes ? Mal . Tis call ' d the Euill . A most myraculous worke in this good King , Which often since my heere remaine in England , I haue seene him do : How he solicites heauen Himselfe best knowes : but strangely visited people All swolne and Vlcerous , pittifull to the eye , The meere dispaire of Surgery , he cures , Hanging a golden stampe about their neckes , Put on with holy Prayers , and ' tis spoken To the succeeding Royalty he leaues The healing Benediction . With this strange vertue , He hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie , And sundry Blessings hang about his Throne , That speake him full of Grace . Enter Rosse . Macd . See who comes heere Malc . My Countryman : but yet I know him not Macd . My euer gentle Cozen , welcome hither Malc . I know him now . Good God betimes remoue The meanes that makes vs Strangers Rosse . Sir , Amen Macd . Stands Scotland where it did ? Rosse . Alas poore Countrey , Almost affraid to know it selfe . It cannot Be call ' d our Mother , but our Graue ; where nothing But who knowes nothing , is once seene to smile : Where sighes , and groanes , and shrieks that rent the ayre Are made , not mark ' d : Where violent sorrow seemes A Moderne extasie : The Deadmans knell , Is there scarse ask ' d for who , and good mens liues Expire before the Flowers in their Caps , Dying , or ere they sicken Macd . Oh Relation ; too nice , and yet too true Malc . What ' s the newest griefe ? Rosse . That of an houres age , doth hisse the speaker , Each minute teemes a new one Macd . How do ' s my Wife ? Rosse . Why well Macd . And all my Children ? Rosse . Well too Macd . The Tyrant ha ' s not batter ' d at their peace ? Rosse . No , they were wel at peace , when I did leaue ' em Macd . Be not a niggard of your speech : How gos ' t ? Rosse . When I came hither to transport the Tydings Which I haue heauily borne , there ran a Rumour Of many worthy Fellowes , that were out , Which was to my beleefe witnest the rather , For that I saw the Tyrants Power a - foot . Now is the time of helpe : your eye in Scotland Would create Soldiours , make our women fight , To doffe their dire distresses Malc . Bee ' t their comfort We are comming thither : Gracious England hath Lent vs good Seyward , and ten thousand men , An older , and a better Souldier , none That Christendome giues out Rosse . Would I could answer This comfort with the like . But I haue words That would be howl ' d out in the desert ayre , Where hearing should not latch them Macd . What concerne they , The generall cause , or is it a Fee - griefe Due to some single brest ? Rosse . No minde that ' s honest But in it shares some woe , though the maine part Pertaines to you alone Macd . If it be mine Keepe it not from me , quickly let me haue it Rosse . Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer , Which shall possesse them with the heauiest sound that euer yet they heard Macd . Humh : I guesse at it Rosse . Your Castle is surpriz ' d : your Wife , and Babes Sauagely slaughter ' d : To relate the manner Were on the Quarry of these murther ' d Deere To adde the death of you Malc . Mercifull Heauen : What man , ne ' re pull your hat vpon your browes : Giue sorrow words ; the griefe that do ' s not speake , Whispers the o ' re - fraught heart , and bids it breake Macd . My Children too ? Ro . Wife , Children , Seruants , all that could be found Macd . And I must be from thence ? My wife kil ' d too ? Rosse . I haue said Malc . Be comforted . Let ' s make vs Med ' cines of our great Reuenge , To cure this deadly greefe Macd . He ha ' s no Children . All my pretty ones ? Did you say All ? Oh Hell - Kite ! All ? What , All my pretty Chickens , and their Damme At one fell swoope ? Malc . Dispute it like a man Macd . I shall do so : But I must also feele it as a man ; I cannot but remember such things were That were most precious to me : Did heauen looke on , And would not take their part ? Sinfull Macduff , They were all strooke for thee : Naught that I am , Not for their owne demerits , but for mine Fell slaughter on their soules : Heauen rest them now Mal . Be this the Whetstone of your sword , let griefe Conuert to anger : blunt not the heart , enrage it Macd . O I could play the woman with mine eyes , And Braggart with my tongue . But gentle Heauens , Cut short all intermission : Front to Front , Bring thou this Fiend of Scotland , and my selfe Within my Swords length set him , if he scape Heauen forgiue him too Mal . This time goes manly : Come go we to the King , our Power is ready , Our lacke is nothing but our leaue .

Enter a Doctor of Physicke , and a Wayting Gentlewoman . Doct . I haue too Nights watch ' d with you , but can perceiue no truth in your report . When was it shee last walk ' d ? Gent . Since his Maiesty went into the Field , I haue seene her rise from her bed , throw her Night - Gown vppon her , vnlocke her Closset , take foorth paper , folde it , write vpon ' t , read it , afterwards Seale it , and againe returne to bed ; yet all this while in a most fast sleepe Doct . A great perturbation in Nature , to receyue at once the benefit of sleep , and do the effects of watching . In this slumbry agitation , besides her walking , and other actuall performances , what ( at any time ) haue you heard her say ? Gent . That Sir , which I will not report after her Doct . You may to me , and ' tis most meet you should Gent . Neither to you , nor any one , hauing no witnesse to confirme my speech . Enter Lady , with a Taper . Lo you , heere she comes : This is her very guise , and vpon my life fast asleepe : obserue her , stand close Doct . How came she by that light ? Gent . Why it stood by her : she ha ' s light by her continually , ' tis her command Doct . You see her eyes are open Gent . I , but their sense are shut Doct . What is it she do ' s now ? Looke how she rubbes her hands Gent . It is an accustom ' d action with her , to seeme thus washing her hands : I haue knowne her continue in this a quarter of an houre Lad . Yet heere ' s a spot Doct . Heark , she speaks , I will set downe what comes from her , to satisfie my remembrance the more strongly La . Out damned spot : out I say . One : Two : Why then ' tis time to doo ' t : Hell is murky . Fye , my Lord , fie , a Souldier , and affear ' d ? what need we feare ? who knowes it , when none can call our powre to accompt : yet who would haue thought the olde man to haue had so much blood in him Doct . Do you marke that ? Lad . The Thane of Fife , had a wife : where is she now ? What will these hands ne ' re be cleane ? No more o ' that my Lord , no more o ' that : you marre all with this starting Doct . Go too , go too : You haue knowne what you should not Gent . She ha ' s spoke what shee should not , I am sure of that : Heauen knowes what she ha ' s knowne La . Heere ' s the smell of the blood still : all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand . Oh , oh , oh Doct . What a sigh is there ? The hart is sorely charg ' d Gent . I would not haue such a heart in my bosome , for the dignity of the whole body Doct . Well , well , well Gent . Pray God it be sir Doct . This disease is beyond my practise : yet I haue knowne those which haue walkt in their sleep , who haue dyed holily in their beds Lad . Wash your hands , put on your Night - Gowne , looke not so pale : I tell you yet againe Banquo ' s buried ; he cannot come out on ' s graue Doct . Euen so ? Lady . To bed , to bed : there ' s knocking at the gate : Come , come , come , come , giue me your hand : What ' s done , cannot be vndone . To bed , to bed , to bed . Exit Lady . Doct . Will she go now to bed ? Gent . Directly Doct . Foule whisp ' rings are abroad : vnnaturall deeds Do breed vnnaturall troubles : infected mindes To their deafe pillowes will discharge their Secrets : More needs she the Diuine , then the Physitian : God , God forgiue vs all . Looke after her , Remoue from her the meanes of all annoyance , And still keepe eyes vpon her : So goodnight , My minde she ha ' s mated , and amaz ' d my sight . I thinke , but dare not speake Gent . Good night good Doctor . Exeunt . Scena Secunda . Drum and Colours . Enter Menteth , Cathnes , Angus , Lenox , Soldiers . Ment .

Reuenges burne in them : for their deere causes Would to the bleeding , and the grim Alarme Excite the mortified man Ang . Neere Byrnan wood Shall we well meet them , that way are they comming Cath . Who knowes if Donalbane be with his brother ? Len . For certaine Sir , he is not : I haue a File Of all the Gentry ; there is Seywards Sonne , And many vnruffe youths , that euen now Protest their first of Manhood Ment . What do ' s the Tyrant Cath . Great Dunsinane he strongly Fortifies : Some say hee ' s mad : Others , that lesser hate him , Do call it valiant Fury , but for certaine He cannot buckle his distemper ' d cause Within the belt of Rule Ang . Now do ' s he feele His secret Murthers sticking on his hands , Now minutely Reuolts vpbraid his Faith - breach : Those he commands , moue onely in command , Nothing in loue : Now do ' s he feele his Title Hang loose about him , like a Giants Robe Vpon a dwarfish Theefe Ment . Who then shall blame His pester ' d Senses to recoyle , and start , When all that is within him , do ' s condemne It selfe , for being there Cath . Well , march we on , To giue Obedience , where ' tis truly ow ' d : Meet we the Med ' cine of the sickly Weale , And with him poure we in our Countries purge , Each drop of vs Lenox . Or so much as it needes , To dew the Soueraigne Flower , and drowne the Weeds : Make we our March towards Birnan . Exeunt . marching . Scaena Tertia . Enter Macbeth , Doctor , and Attendants . Macb . Bring me no more Reports , let them flye all : Till Byrnane wood remoue to Dunsinane , I cannot taint with Feare . What ' s the Boy Malcolme ? Was he not borne of woman ? The Spirits that know All mortall Consequences , haue pronounc ' d me thus : Feare not Macbeth , no man that ' s borne of woman Shall ere haue power vpon thee . Then fly false Thanes , And mingle with the English Epicures , The minde I sway by , and the heart I beare , Shall neuer sagge with doubt , nor shake with feare . Enter Seruant . The diuell damne thee blacke , thou cream - fac ' d Loone : Where got ' st thou that Goose - looke Ser . There is ten thousand Macb . Geese Villaine ? Ser . Souldiers Sir Macb . Go pricke thy face , and ouer - red thy feare Thou Lilly - liuer ' d Boy . What Soldiers , Patch ? Death of thy Soule , those Linnen cheekes of thine Are Counsailers to feare . What Soldiers Whay - face ? Ser . The English Force , so please you Macb . Take thy face hence . Seyton , I am sick at hart , When I behold : Seyton , I say , this push Will cheere me euer , or dis - eate me now . I haue liu ' d long enough : my way of life Is falne into the Seare , the yellow Leafe , And that which should accompany Old - Age , As Honor , Loue , Obedience , Troopes of Friends , I must not looke to haue : but in their steed , Curses , not lowd but deepe , Mouth - honor , breath Which the poore heart would faine deny , and dare not . Seyton ? Enter Seyton . Sey . What ' s your gracious pleasure ? Macb . What Newes more ? Sey . All is confirm ' d my Lord , which was reported Macb . Ile fight , till from my bones , my flesh be hackt . Giue me my Armor Seyt . ' Tis not needed yet Macb . Ile put it on : Send out moe Horses , skirre the Country round , Hang those that talke of Feare . Giue me mine Armor : How do ' s your Patient , Doctor ? Doct . Not so sicke my Lord , As she is troubled with thicke - comming Fancies That keepe her from her rest Macb . Cure of that : Can ' st thou not Minister to a minde diseas ' d , Plucke from the Memory a rooted Sorrow , Raze out the written troubles of the Braine , And with some sweet Obliuious Antidote Cleanse the stufft bosome , of that perillous stuffe Which weighes vpon the heart ? Doct . Therein the Patient Must minister to himselfe Macb . Throw Physicke to the Dogs , Ile none of it . Come , put mine Armour on : giue me my Staffe : Seyton , send out : Doctor , the Thanes flye from me : Come sir , dispatch . If thou could ' st Doctor , cast The Water of my Land , finde her Disease , And purge it to a sound and pristine Health , I would applaud thee to the very Eccho , That should applaud againe . Pull ' t off I say , What Rubarb , Cyme , or what Purgatiue drugge Would scowre these English hence : hear ' st y of them ? Doct . I my good Lord : your Royall Preparation Makes vs heare something Macb . Bring it after me : I will not be affraid of Death and Bane , Till Birnane Forrest come to Dunsinane Doct .

We doubt it nothing Seyw . What wood is this before vs ? Ment . The wood of Birnane Malc . Let euery Souldier hew him downe a Bough , And bear ' t before him , thereby shall we shadow The numbers of our Hoast , and make discouery Erre in report of vs Sold . It shall be done Syw . We learne no other , but the confident Tyrant Keepes still in Dunsinane , and will indure Our setting downe befor ' t Malc . ' Tis his maine hope : For where there is aduantage to be giuen , Both more and lesse haue giuen him the Reuolt , And none serue with him , but constrained things , Whose hearts are absent too Macd . Let our iust Censures Attend the true euent , and put we on Industrious Souldiership Sey . The time approaches , That will with due decision make vs know What we shall say we haue , and what we owe : Thoughts speculatiue , their vnsure hopes relate , But certaine issue , stroakes must arbitrate , Towards which , aduance the warre . Exeunt . marching Scena Quinta . Enter Macbeth , Seyton , & Souldiers , with Drum and Colours . Macb . Hang out our Banners on the outward walls , The Cry is still , they come : our Castles strength Will laugh a Siedge to scorne : Heere let them lye , Till Famine and the Ague eate them vp : Were they not forc ' d with those that should be ours , We might haue met them darefull , beard to beard , And beate them backward home . What is that noyse ? A Cry within of Women . Sey . It is the cry of women , my good Lord Macb . I haue almost forgot the taste of Feares : The time ha ' s beene , my sences would haue cool ' d To heare a Night - shrieke , and my Fell of haire Would at a dismall Treatise rowze , and stirre As life were in ' t . I haue supt full with horrors , Direnesse familiar to my slaughterous thoughts Cannot once start me . Wherefore was that cry ? Sey . The Queene ( my Lord ) is dead Macb . She should haue dy ' de heereafter ; There would haue beene a time for such a word : To morrow , and to morrow , and to morrow , Creepes in this petty pace from day to day , To the last Syllable of Recorded time : And all our yesterdayes , haue lighted Fooles The way to dusty death . Out , out , breefe Candle , Life ' s but a walking Shadow , a poore Player , That struts and frets his houre vpon the Stage , And then is heard no more . It is a Tale Told by an Ideot , full of sound and fury Signifying nothing . Enter a Messenger . Thou com ' st to vse thy Tongue : thy Story quickly Mes . Gracious my Lord , I should report that which I say I saw , But know not how to doo ' t Macb . Well , say sir Mes . As I did stand my watch vpon the Hill I look ' d toward Byrnane , and anon me thought The Wood began to moue Macb . Lyar , and Slaue Mes . Let me endure your wrath , if ' t be not so : Within this three Mile may you see it comming . I say , a mouing Groue Macb . If thou speak ' st false , Vpon the next Tree shall thou hang aliue Till Famine cling thee : If thy speech be sooth , I care not if thou dost for me as much . I pull in Resolution , and begin To doubt th ' Equiuocation of the Fiend , That lies like truth . Feare not , till Byrnane Wood Do come to Dunsinane , and now a Wood Comes toward Dunsinane . Arme , Arme , and out , If this which he auouches , do ' s appeare , There is nor flying hence , nor tarrying here . I ' ginne to be a - weary of the Sun , And wish th ' estate o ' th ' world were now vndon . Ring the Alarum Bell , blow Winde , come wracke , At least wee ' l dye with Harnesse on our backe . Exeunt . Scena Sexta . Drumme and Colours . Enter Malcolme , Seyward , Macduffe , and their Army , with Boughes . Mal . Now neere enough : Your leauy Skreenes throw downe , And shew like those you are : You ( worthy Vnkle ) Shall with my Cosin your right Noble Sonne Leade our first Battell . Worthy Macduffe , and wee Shall take vpon ' s what else remaines to do , According to our order Sey . Fare you well : Do we but finde the Tyrants power to night , Let vs be beaten , if we cannot fight Macd . Make all our Trumpets speak , giue the [ m ] all breath Those clamorous Harbingers of Blood , & Death . Exeunt . Alarums continued . Scena Septima . Enter Macbeth . Macb . They haue tied me to a stake , I cannot flye , But Beare - like I must fight the course . What ' s he That was not borne of Woman ? Such a one Am I to feare , or none . Enter young Seyward . Y . Sey . What is thy name ? Macb . Thou ' lt be affraid to heare it Y . Sey . No : though thou call ' st thy selfe a hoter name Then any is in hell Macb . My name ' s Macbeth Y . Sey . The diuell himselfe could not pronounce a Title More hatefull to mine eare Macb . No : nor more fearefull Y . Sey . Thou lyest abhorred Tyrant , with my Sword Ile proue the lye thou speak ' st . Fight , and young Seyward slaine . Macb . Thou was ' t borne of woman ; But Swords I smile at , Weapons laugh to scorne , Brandish ' d by man that ' s of a Woman borne . Enter . Alarums . Enter Macduffe . Macd . That way the noise is : Tyrant shew thy face , If thou beest slaine , and with no stroake of mine , My Wife and Childrens Ghosts will haunt me still : I cannot strike at wretched Kernes , whose armes Are hyr ' d to beare their Staues ; either thou Macbeth , Or else my Sword with an vnbattered edge I sheath againe vndeeded . There thou should ' st be , By this great clatter , one of greatest note Seemes bruited . Let me finde him Fortune , And more I begge not . Exit . Alarums . Enter Malcolme and Seyward . Sey . This way my Lord , the Castles gently rendred : The Tyrants people , on both sides do fight , The Noble Thanes do brauely in the Warre , The day almost it selfe professes yours , And little is to do Malc . We haue met with Foes That strike beside vs Sey . Enter Sir , the Castle . Exeunt . Alarum Enter Macbeth . Macb . Why should I play the Roman Foole , and dye On mine owne sword ? whiles I see liues , the gashes Do better vpon them . Enter Macduffe . Macd . Turne Hell - hound , turne Macb . Of all men else I haue auoyded thee : But get thee backe , my soule is too much charg ' d With blood of thine already Macd . I haue no words , My voice is in my Sword , thou bloodier Villaine Then tearmes can giue thee out . Fight : Alarum Macb . Thou loosest labour As easie may ' st thou the intrenchant Ayre With thy keene Sword impresse , as make me bleed : Let fall thy blade on vulnerable Crests , I beare a charmed Life , which must not yeeld To one of woman borne Macd . Dispaire thy Charme , And let the Angell whom thou still hast seru ' d Tell thee , Macduffe was from his Mothers womb Vntimely ript Macb . Accursed be that tongue that tels mee so ; For it hath Cow ' d my better part of man : And be these Iugling Fiends no more beleeu ' d , That palter with vs in a double sence , That keepe the word of promise to our eare , And breake it to our hope . Ile not fight with thee Macd . Then yeeld thee Coward , And liue to be the shew , and gaze o ' th ' time . Wee ' l haue thee , as our rarer Monsters are Painted vpon a pole , and vnder - writ , Heere may you see the Tyrant Macb . I will not yeeld To kisse the ground before young Malcolmes feet , And to be baited with the Rabbles curse . Though Byrnane wood be come to Dunsinane , And thou oppos ' d , being of no woman borne , Yet I will try the last . Before my body , I throw my warlike Shield : Lay on Macduffe , And damn ' d be him , that first cries hold , enough . Exeunt . fighting . Alarums . Enter Fighting , and Macbeth slaine . Retreat , and Flourish . Enter with Drumme and Colours , Malcolm , Seyward , Rosse , Thanes , & Soldiers . Mal . I would the Friends we misse , were safe arriu ' d Sey . Some must go off : and yet by these I see , So great a day as this is cheapely bought Mal . Macduffe is missing , and your Noble Sonne Rosse . Your son my Lord , ha ' s paid a souldiers debt , He onely liu ' d but till he was a man , The which no sooner had his Prowesse confirm ' d In the vnshrinking station where he fought , But like a man he dy ' de Sey . Then he is dead ? Rosse . I , and brought off the field : your cause of sorrow Must not be measur ' d by his worth , for then It hath no end Sey . Had he his hurts before ? Rosse . I , on the Front Sey . Why then , Gods Soldier be he : Had I as many Sonnes , as I haue haires , I would not wish them to a fairer death : And so his Knell is knoll ' d Mal . Hee ' s worth more sorrow , and that Ile spend for him Sey . He ' s worth no more , They say he parted well , and paid his score , And so God be with him . Here comes newer comfort . Enter Macduffe , with Macbeths head . Macd . Haile King , for so thou art . Behold where stands Th ' Vsurpers cursed head : the time is free : I see thee compast with thy Kingdomes Pearle , That speake my salutation in their minds : Whose voyces I desire alowd with mine . Haile King of Scotland All . Haile King of Scotland . Flourish . Mal . We shall not spend a large expence of time , Before we reckon with your seuerall loues , And make vs euen with you . My Thanes and Kinsmen Henceforth be Earles , the first that euer Scotland In such an Honor nam ' d : What ' s more to do , Which would be planted newly with the time , As calling home our exil ' d Friends abroad , That fled the Snares of watchfull Tyranny , Producing forth the cruell Ministers Of this dead Butcher , and his Fiend - like Queene ; Who ( as ' tis thought ) by selfe and violent hands , Tooke off her life . This , and what need full else That call ' s vpon vs , by the Grace of Grace , We will performe in measure , time , and place : So thankes to all at once , and to each one , Whom we inuite , to see vs Crown ' d at Scone . Flourish . Exeunt Omnes . FINIS . THE TRAGEDIE OF MACBETH .\""
